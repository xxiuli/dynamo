{"document":"The visitors were closing in on three points thanks to Christian Nade's first-half penalty and a fine finish from Robert Thomson.\nBut Martin Boyle's late effort - after Daniel Harvie scored an own goal and James Keatings had a penalty saved - earned Hibs a point.\nA mistake from goalkeeper Alan Martin handed Boyle the equaliser.\nIt meant two lost points for Dumbarton, who fall behind Raith Rovers, into eighth spot after the Kirkcaldy side's win over Dundee United.\nDumbarton looked extremely well organised at the back in the first half, with space for the Hibs strikers at a premium.\nAnd the visitors were awarded the chance to take a shock first-half lead when Marvin Bartley needlessly bundled Andy Stirling to the ground just inside the home team's 18-yard box.\nFormer Hearts striker Christian Nade made no mistake in despatching the ball beyond goalkeeper Ofir Marciano.\nWhen the home side equalised through a Harvie own goal, few inside the ground would have expected anything else other than Hibs going on to secure a victory.\nHowever, Thomson restored the visitors' lead with a stunning shot from 22 yards out to give the travelling support hope their team could secure their first win at Easter Road in more than 30 years.\nMartin, on loan from Hamilton Academical, had an afternoon he is likely to remember for a long long time.\nHe kept Hibs at bay with stunning saves from Keatings and Brian Graham. None better than the penalty stop from Keatings that denied Hibs an equaliser after they laid siege on the visitors' goal.\nHowever, only he knows what he was thinking about when he dropped the ball on the edge of his box, allowing Boyle to nod the ball into the empty net to salvage a point.\nIf, or indeed when, Neil Lennon manages to get his Hibs side over the line and secure their place back at Scottish football's top table, he will have plenty to think about regarding who he should retain on the playing staff.\nWith 10 draws in the league this season, the Easter Road side are far from the finished article and the inconsistency shown at times by many of his squad could lead them towards the exit door in the summer.\nWith two huge games coming up in the next 10 days against their closest challengers, Falkirk and Greenock Morton, the league title could all but be in the bag.\nHowever, any slip ups and those two, under two of the shrewdest managers around, Peter Houston and Jim Duffy, will look to pounce.\nHibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \"I'm frustrated as we deserved to win the game. Ridiculous goals we are giving away.\n\"Our attitude towards the game in the first half wasn't good enough.\n\"This team has to be more consistent. I'm not scratching my head because I see it so often now.\n\"We are at home, but the malaise sets in and they are not learning.\n\"If they think they are going to get to the Premiership playing like that, they won't - and, if they think they are going to play like that in the Premiership, they will have to think again because it's not acceptable.\"\nDumbarton manager Stephen Aitken: \"I certainly enjoyed the performance of the players. We enjoyed the result.\n\"It could have been a bit better, but if we are assessing the game in an honest manner then Hibs bossed the game in the second half.\n\"The goalkeeper makes a save from the penalty, so we have to be happy. He is gutted about the equaliser, but at the same time, he kept us in the game.\n\"He walked in and apologised for costing his team three points, but I said to him he gained us a point.\"\nMatch ends, Hibernian 2, Dumbarton 2.\nSecond Half ends, Hibernian 2, Dumbarton 2.\nFoul by Brian Graham (Hibernian).\n(Dumbarton) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nCorner,  Hibernian.

Parental Advisory; may contain scenes of disorder and bad language.\nWatch out for responses to the Scottish Parliament's decision on whether it wants to hold a second independence referendum.\nElsewhere there's a lot of finishing-off on not very controversial bills - with the biggest contested legislation probably the Digital Economy Bill, where there are a number of major issues in play - including new \"fit and proper person\" tests for the individuals running companies involved in media mergers and acquisitions, and the creation of new offences around online ticket-touting.\nHere's my rundown of the coming week:\nThe Commons opens (2.30pm) with Education questions - and any post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will normally follow at 3.30pm.\nThe main debate is on the second reading of the Prisons and Courts Bill - which aims to reform the prison system, strengthening safety and security, improving efficiency and services for users in courts and tribunals, and reforming the claims process for minor whiplash injuries resulting from road traffic accidents. It also provides for greater use of mobile phone blocking technology in prisons.\nIn Westminster Hall (4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 166847,  which complains that insurance companies are making it harder and harder for people aged 18 to 25 years of age to start driving. Premiums for first year drivers can be ÃÂ£2,500 or more - completely unaffordable for many. The petition has attracted 185,175 signatures.\nOn the committee corridor, Public Accounts has a headline grabbing session (3.30pm) on ambulance services - they will quiz Department of Health Permanent Secretary Chris Wormald about evidence that half a million hours of ambulance time are wasted every year, as ambulances queue outside Accident and Emergency departments.\nThere's also a ground-breaking meeting of the Scottish Affairs Committee (1.15pm) in what is effectively a joint session with the Scottish Parliament's Social Security Committee, to look at the impact of devolving control of disability benefits to Holyrood.\nIn theory the MSPs will be witnesses, but they will be sitting around the same table as MPs and quizzing witnesses. This could become the template for more joint working between parliaments.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm), peers will be have their second day of report stage debate on the detail of the Digital Economy Bill, where peers will consider clauses dealing with online pornography and age verification (including calls to ensure that data used for age verification to be kept confidential), social media abuse, Ofcom, the BBC licence fee (new clause from Lib Dem super-lawyer Lord Lester would require the PM, and all ministers and agencies to protect the independence of the BBC and reserve the licence fee exclusively for the BBC).\nAnother new clause (32A) calls for the creation of an independent BBC Licence Fee Commission to recommend what the charge should be.\nWatch out for New Clause 33ZG which aims to ensure the main public service broadcasters -  BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4 and Five - are at the top of channel listings or Electronic Programme Guides on all TV platforms. On the new Sky box (Sky Q) the default when you turn your TV on is not live TV but the 'Top Picks' of recent programmes chosen by Sky.\nThe Commons day begins (11.30am) with Health questions.\nThe day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is from Labour's Karen Buck - who wants to require householders to notify local authorities of an intention to register accommodation for short or holiday lets. She's concerned about the impact of letting through sites like Airbnb - you can let for 90 days, but many people are doing far more than that, and such letting a can breach mortgage agreements and insurance terms - and there's a huge emerging problem about it invalidating the insurance for commonhold properties.\nOther issues include controlling anti-social behaviour and tax evasion. Councils are having to monitor websites to keep track of letting levels on their patch and enforce the law...\nMPs then dispatch the report and third reading of the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Bill  which deals with the problems of threats to sue for infringement being abused, to stifle new ideas and competition. This is an uncontroversial technical measure - and should be waved through with minimal debate. After that MPs will have a general debate on fuel poverty.\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Will Quince, is on public health guidance and baby loss - he has spoken in the Commons about his experience of having his son stillborn.\nIn Westminster Hall, debates include the relationship between the DVLA and private car parking companies - Kevin Foster (9.30am-11am);  the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome - Stephen Gethins (11am-11.30am); the UN international day for the elimination of racial discrimination - Dawn Butler (2.30pm-4pm);  pensions in the nuclear decommissioning industry - Patricia Gibson (4pm-4.30pm) and Stoke on Trent, City of Culture 2021 - Ruth Smeeth (4.30pm-5.30pm).\nMy committee pick is the Home Affairs hearing (2.15pm) on hate crime and its violent consequences, where the witnesses are all MPs: Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker in charge of MP security, Home Office Minister Sarah Newton and the Solicitor-General Robert Buckland.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) the main event is a government debate on the current challenges to the international rules-based order; the preparedness of the UK's armed forces and that of Nato; and the levers available to HMG to promote the country's defence and security interests.\nThis debate and a Statutory Instrument approval motion on the Armed Forces Act 2017, to maintain parliamentary approval for the armed forces, will be taken together. These are followed by a short debate on the EU Committee's report on Brexit - Gibraltar.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.\nThere will then be some brief formalities as the Labour MP and former Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz, presents a bill to increase the minimum custodial sentence on conviction for possession of a knife or other offensive weapon for an offender aged 18 years or over and to increase the minimum period of a detention and training order for a person aged 16 or 17; to set a minimum custodial sentence on conviction for an offender in possession of a knife or other weapon and intending to commit any offence or having such a weapon available to use in committing murder. He won't make a speech - but the title of the bill will be read out....\nThen comes what could turn out to be a very lively event indeed; Tim Farron will present a Ten Minute Rule Bill for a second EU referendum \"on the proposed terms for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union\" (see above).\nThe day's main legislating is on the Pension Schemes Bill, which deals with the regulation of master trust pension schemes - a popular option under the new auto-enrolment system.  MPs are expected to polish off the report and third reading stages of debate fairly rapidly.... and they will then move on to a general debate on exiting the European Union and global trade.\nIn Westminster Hall, the subjects for debate include Iran's influence in the Middle East (9.30am -11am) and the roll-out of universal credit (2.30pm-4pm) - Newcastle MP Catherine McKinnell says her constituency office has been \"overwhelmed\" with casework relating to the problems around the 'Full Service' Universal Credit\nMy committee pick is the Work and Pensions hearing (9.30am) on self-employment and the gig economy, with evidence from experts and think-tanks. This picks up on the Budget controversy around National Insurance for the self-employed.\nIn the Lords (3pm) there are some amendments down for the third reading debate on the Higher Education and Research Bill , where the government has suffered a series of defeats at report stage, but they all come from the government spokesman, Lord Younger of Leckie, so they will be technical tidying-up or to meet assurances given during earlier stages of debate.\nThen comes the final half-day of report stage consideration on the Digital Economy Bill, where more significant issues will be up for debate, including the rules on the \"Crown Jewels\" listed sports events, the suddenly topical subject of media mergers - watch out for a new clause proposed by Labour's Lord Puttnam and the Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Lansley, which would require Ofcom to impose a \"fit and proper persons\" test for individuals involved in mergers of broadcasting and media enterprises.\nThis would include looking at the \"extent of any criminal wrongdoing that has taken place by companies and other organisations under their control; and the extent of any failures of corporate governance and management in such companies and organisations\".\nPeers will also look at new laws on ticket touting, including outlawing \"bots\" which buy up tickets online before fans can buy them - a practice which makes it difficult for ordinary folk to buy tickets without paying a considerable mark-up to online ticket touts.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with International Trade questions followed by Women and Equalities questions, and the weekly Business Statement setting out the future agenda for the Commons. It's also the last chance for the Leader of the House, David Lidington, to keep his promise to hold a debate on moving parliament out of its Victorian home before Easter.\nThen the Conservative Bob Blackman leads a debate on the compensation due to Equitable Life policy holders in the light of the Parliamentary Ombudsman's ruling that the collapsed company had not been properly regulated. The motion calls on the government to make a commitment to provide \"full compensation to victims of the scandal as the economy continues to recover\".\nThe day's second backbench debate, led by an interesting alliance of the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg; the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, and Labour's Lucy Powell, a former shadow education secretary, on the annual State of the Nation report from the Social Mobility Commission. The motion highlights the Commission's warning that social mobility is getting worse, and calls on the government to lead a renewed approach in the early years, in education, skills and housing, to improve social mobility.\nIn Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there are debates on two select committee reports - on the Syrian refugee crisis, from the International Development Committee, and on DfID's programme in Nigeria, from the International Development Committee.\nIn the Lords (11am) peers debate the report from the Science and Technology Committee,  A time for boldness: EU membership and UK science after the referendum.  And then the report from the EU Committee: Brexit: environment and climate change.\nThe Commons sits (9.30am) for its final day on the current crop of private members' bills.\nAnd while the agenda lists an impressive number of bills for debate, in practice only the first few will be considered.\nThe ones with top priority are the bills which have cleared their committee stage consideration, starting with the Conservative Wendy Morton's pretty uncontroversial Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, which extends public access to certain local council audit documents.\n\"I am ever the optimist for PMBs on sitting Fridays,\" she told me. If her bill is rubber stamped through its report stage and third reading, fairly rapidly, MPs will move on to the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill, a tidying-up measure to remove obsolete offences from the statute book, proposed by the Conservative John Glen.\nOn its last appearance, it was denied formal approval without debate, after a Conservative colleague, Chris Chope, objected to it because MPs had not discussed the amendment which would make the bill retrospective. Mr Glen hopes to get the bill through, unamended, with the backing of the government and Labour, and if he does, another Conservative, Kevin Hollinrake, might have time to get his Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill through third reading, too.\nA long list of bills lurks further down the agenda - but they have no chance of being debated, and will be ritually pole-axed at the end of the day's proceedings.\nAlthough some may well be re-incarnated in the next parliamentary year's private members' bill process, which will get underway when the lucky winners of a bloc of debating time are announced, at some point in June.","summary":"After the sound and fury of the Brexit Bill, the Westminster agenda seems rather more quiet in the coming week, with much of the most significant action taking place on the committee corridor.","id":"39305412"}

{"document":"He was making a rare public speech as part of mass celebrations involving troops, and military vehicles in Pyongyang to mark the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party.\nThousands of soldiers - many with red banners - marched past him through the city's main square in tight formation.\nAn aircraft flypast forming the number 70 flew over the square.\nTanks and missile carriers rolled past the podium where Mr Kim spoke.\nParade in pictures\nAt the scene: Steve Evans, BBC News, Pyongyang\nThe parade was truly amazing in its immensity and organisation. It lasted for two hours with countless rows of soldiers and then civilians marching past without break.\nIt felt at times like a meeting of a cult with citizens of North Korea jumping up and down and waving ecstatically at Kim Jong-un.\nThe message was clear from the podium:  China stands by North Korea - signalled by Kim Jong-un clutching the hand of a senior Chinese leader - and, secondly, that Mr Kim shows no sign of a softer stance towards the United States. As he put it:  \"The party's revolutionary armament means we are ready to fight any kind of war waged by the US imperialists\".\nIf his words were not clear enough, the hardware on parade underlined them - line upon line of trucks with missiles following line upon line of heavy artillery.\nThe changing face of North Korea\nStrange history of North Korea's Communist Party\nState television carried the events live, adding an emotional commentary.\n\"Iron spirit and the united forces of our army and people have enabled us to break through the imperialists' sanctions and isolation, are forcing the enemies to extreme anxiety and fear,\" Mr Kim said.\nLater, as the parade continued, tens of thousands of civilians, including school-children, danced and waved coloured pom-poms.\nWhen it announced plans for the anniversary earlier this year, the government spoke of \"cutting-edge\" weaponry suitable for modern warfare, and the day's event will have been closely watched for any new military hardware indicating the North's military development.\nNo world leaders attended but China, North Korea's closest ally, sent a senior Communist Party official to the anniversary.\nThe North Korean leader began the day by paying respects to his late father and grandfather at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, official media reported.\nThe celebrations continued, after a downpour of rain, with an evening torchlight parade which thousands of Pyongyang citizens have been seen practising for in public squares across the city.\nA late-night concert featuring the all-female Moranbong Band - North Korea's most popular musical group - was also held, which cost foreigners wanting to attend about $115 (ÃÂ£75), the Associated Press news agency reports.\nNorth Korea's nuclear programme has long been a cause for alarm in the region.\nPyongyang is believed to have conducted three underground nuclear tests and is threatening a fourth, despite international condemnation and sanctions.\nLast month, it announced it was restarting its main nuclear facility Yongbyon and that it was improving its nuclear weapons \"in quality and quantity\".\nThe North claims it has made a nuclear device small enough to fit into the warhead of a missile.\nUS officials, however, have cast doubt on this claim and experts say it is difficult to assess the progress North Korea has made on miniaturisation.\nNorth and South Korea remain technically at war because the 1950-1953 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.","summary":"North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, has said his country could defend itself in any war started by the US.","id":"34493672"}

{"document":"It follows reports in a German paper of repeated clashes between Theresa May and Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at a Downing Street dinner.\nEU sources claimed UK misunderstanding of the talks process, and ignorance about how Brussels works, could lead to no deal being agreed on the UK's exit.\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said the reports were \"tittle-tattle\".\nShe said the emergence of the reports was \"not the right way\" of negotiating, but the UK was committed to negotiating in \"good faith\".\nAccording to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the prime minister and Mr Juncker reportedly clashed over Mrs May's desire to make Brexit \"a success\" and whether the issue of protecting the rights of expat UK and EU nationals could be agreed as early as June.\nThe newspaper claimed Mr Juncker said: \"I leave... 10 times more sceptical than I was before.\"\nIn a speech later on Tuesday, Mrs May - who has dismissed the account as \"Brussels gossip\" - will cite the need to stand up to the other 27 EU countries\n\"We have seen in recent days, it will not be easy,\" she will say. \"The negotiations ahead will be tough. Across the table from us sit 27 European member states who are united in their determination to do a deal that works for them.\"\nThe German newspaper's report of the dinner last Wednesday, which looks to have come via European Commission sources, said that after the PM said she wanted to \"make Brexit a success\", Mr Juncker's response was: \"Brexit cannot be a success. The more I hear, the more sceptical I become.\"\nAnd when she said the UK owes no money to the EU, the president informed her that she was not leaving a \"golf club\".\nThe article said that, after last week's dinner, Mr Juncker was shocked at Mrs May's suggestion that a deal on citizens' rights could be achieved so quickly.\nThe German newspaper report also suggested Mr Juncker said there would be no trade deal between the UK and the rest of the EU if the UK failed to pay the \"divorce\" bill which it is expected to be asked for.\nReports also claim that the morning after the dinner last Wednesday Mr Juncker told German chancellor Angela Merkel that Mrs May was \"on a different galaxy\".\nA senior Conservative source told the BBC that the party would \"rise above\" all the media coverage but rejected accounts of the dinner, saying: \"We really, really do not recognise those reports.\"\nMs Rudd said the UK would not be responding to the claims but the government had set out a clear plan and priorities for the talks and Mrs May was the best person to negotiate a Brexit deal that was in the UK's \"national interest\".\n\"Once you start engaging in gossip, in tittle-tattle in this way, it (will) carry on and who knows where it will lead?\" she told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Nobody knows how much truth there is in gossip. But there are ways of conveying what is going on and this is not the right way.\n\"I do not recognise the tone in which this has been reported but I come back to the fact that it does make it clear that it is going to be a complex, potentially difficult negotiation at times and who do we want leading those - we want Theresa May leading them, not Jeremy Corbyn.\"\nWelcome to the EU\/UK dominated Brexit Galaxy of Spin and Counter-Spin.

This all seems rather inflammatory, so who's right and who's stretching the truth?\nThe accounts of the dinner were seized upon by European politicians and opposition parties in the UK.\nGuy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said it was time to \"get real\". He tweeted: \"Any Brexit deal requires a strong and stable understanding of the complex issues involved.\"\nFormer Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Theresa May's desire to pull the UK out of the single market and other EU institutions was leading to an \"increasingly belligerent\" atmosphere with the EU.\n\"No 10 appears to be treating the rest of the EU as if they are running the Home Office, just barking instructions and expecting them to fall into line,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today\n\"This is a complex, Rubik's Cube negotiation which requires agility and charm to be successful. None of that appears to have been in evidence at that dinner last week.\"\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was sending out \"rather mixed messages\".\n\"To start negotiations by threatening to walk away with no deal and set up a low tax economy on the shores of Europe is not a very sensible way of approaching people with whom half of our trade is done at the present time.\"\nHowever, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall urged Mrs May not to give any ground, tweeting: \"We don't owe the EU a penny and in fact there is a pretty good case that they owe us.\"\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning","summary":"The UK will not enter into \"a briefing war\" with the European Commission over Brexit talks, Tory sources have said.","id":"39776710"}

{"document":"His comments were captured in a recording of a closed-door meeting, the Daily Beast reported.\nThe current round of direct peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians appear to be at an impasse.\nBut President Barack Obama has said the US will not abandon its peace efforts.\nBy Paul DanaharBBC Washington bureau chief\nThe US state department is telling everyone that it's no big deal that John Kerry used the 'A' word to describe the impact on Israel if the two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict collapses.\nA spokeswoman has pointed out that senior Israeli politicians have also referenced apartheid before when talking about the risks to Israel's reputation. This point though is frankly spin. It is one thing for Israeli politicians to use provocative language in their own political arena. When used by the US secretary of state it adds legitimacy to the debate about whether there is an equivalence between the old South African regime and the situation on the West Bank.\nWhether the \"apartheid\" reference was a gaffe or deliberate there is no doubt that Secretary Kerry believes Israel's government is stubbornly ignoring his warnings that a failure to agree a peace deal will feed a campaign trying to delegitimise their state.\nMr Obama has previously rejected the use of the term \"apartheid\" in discussion of the Middle East peace process, calling it unhelpful and inaccurate.\nBut in remarks before a group of high-ranking officials from the US, Europe and Japan known as the Trilateral Commission, Mr Kerry used the word.\n\"A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative,\" Mr Kerry said, according to the Daily Beast.\n\"Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens - or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.\"\nMr Kerry also reportedly suggested a peace deal was more likely to come with a change in Israeli and Palestinian leadership, and strongly criticised Jewish settlement construction on occupied territory.\nThe American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) condemned his comments as \"deeply troubling\".\n\"Any suggestion that Israel is, or is at risk of becoming, an apartheid state is offensive and inappropriate,\" it said in a statement.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the US state department noted that Israeli leaders had used the term \"apartheid state\" before, to warn of the consequences of the failure of the peace process.\n\"Secretary Kerry, like Justice Minister [Tzipi] Livni, and previous Israeli Prime Ministers [Ehud] Olmert and [Ehud] Barak, was reiterating why there's no such thing as a one-state solution if you believe, as he does, in the principle of a Jewish state,\" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\n\"He was talking about the kind of future Israel wants and the kind of future both Israelis and Palestinians would want to envision. The only way to have two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two-state solution. And without a two-state solution, the level of prosperity and security the Israeli and Palestinian people deserve isn't possible.\"\nLast week, Israel suspended the current round of US-brokered peace talks, which resumed last July after a three-year hiatus, demanding the annulment of a reconciliation agreement between two main Palestinian factions.\nFatah, which is led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas, which governs Gaza, said they planned to form a unity government in the coming weeks.\nHamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is designated a terrorist group by the US, EU, Israel and other countries.\nMr Netanyahu told the BBC that Mr Abbas could \"have peace with Israel or a pact with Hamas - he can't have both\".\nThe US expressed \"disappointment\" over the unity deal, but pushed for the talks to continue.\nLast week, Mr Obama said his administration would continue to offer \"constructive approaches\".

So what's going on?\nAt the end of February, Lotte finally agreed to provide land it owned in South Korea - which includes part of a golf course - so the US could build its controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system.\nWith the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles, the US says it is an important line of defence against North Korea's missile development programme.\nBut over the past few months, Beijing has been lobbying heavily against it - saying the system's powerful radars are capable of monitoring Chinese territory.\nIt disputes the argument that it will bring more stability to the region, saying it should not be allowed to go ahead.\nAs well as its shops and food businesses, Lotte also has hotels and cinemas in China.

He helped the Magpies win promotion back to the Premier League and also won promotion via the play-offs after his move to QPR.\nIn 2014 he signed for Leicester and is now a Premier League champion. He was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend last May - a conviction he is appealing against.\nThe 30-year-old had been persuaded to join the Foxes by then manager Nigel Pearson, who was sacked in June. Fuchs said he was lying on a beach in Antigua when he was told Pearson had been sacked. \"I'd spoken to a coach, he'd convinced me to go there, and I will never have one training session with him.

{"document":"The so-called Valley fire is thought to be one of the worst in the state's history, and is still only 30% contained, spanning three counties.\nOne disabled woman has died and four firefighters have been injured, while 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes.\nTwo dozen fires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington state.\nBut the most destruction is in California, where mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in some areas so residents can return to survey the devastation.\nFirefighters are scrambling to protect not only homes but the state's famed giant Sequoia trees, as the largest of a dozen fires edges ever closer to one of the national parks in which they grow.\nWhile the Valley fire has been the most destructive, covering an area twice the size of San Francisco, a second known as the Butte fire, outside Sacramento, has claimed 166 homes.\nFirefighters say it is covering 71,780 acres (29,048 hectares) and is now 40% contained.\nOfficials say fire teams have been helped by cooler weather and higher humidity, although the forecast is for higher temperatures to return at the weekend\nIn California, the sound of summer is the crackle of flames. No one here in Lake County can remember anything like the Valley Fire.\nFirefighters say it has already consumed an area twice the size of San Francisco. And still it burns, leaving behind a landscape drained of colour, silent and lifeless.\nRanches which stood here for more than a century were wiped out in seconds. And in the little communities of Cobb, Middletown and Hidden Valley, entire streets have been destroyed.\nFor mile after mile the ashes are still smouldering. Most people have not yet been allowed to return to inspect the damage but when they do many will find that there is nothing to salvage.\nCooler weather with some moisture in the air is helping but it will take more than that to stop the blaze. The fires burns and burns and California is counting the cost.\nIn northern California, people who have been evacuated from their homes or lost their homes completely are gathered at emergency centres and high schools.\nAndy Elliott, a British firefighter working to battle the Valley fire, said it is one of the most extreme in California for a long time.\nFirefighters are calling it a \"career fire\", such is its speed and force, he said. \"The fire behaviour is unprecedented.\"\nMr Elliot said he knew the four injured firefighters and had breakfast with them just before they were hurt.\n\"It's a very extreme incident... very sad.\"\nCalifornia is used to battling raging wildfires. But after a four-year drought, the state is suffering more than usual - 5,255 fires have scorched 217,827 acres of land so far this year, compared with 3,638 fires burning 90,894 acres during the same period last year.\nNorthern California is currently bearing the brunt of the blazes, with 13,000 firefighters working 24-hour shifts to try to contain more than a dozen fires sweeping across parched hillsides in Butte, Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties.\nBut Calfire's Lynnette Round says more wildfires could start anywhere in the state at any given moment. \"The terrain is so dried up that even if it rains a little, trees and brush are so dry, they could ignite at any time,\" she says.\nSouthern California typically experiences its worst wildfires in October and November, when ferocious Santa Ana winds - which blow from the desert to the coast - can reach up to 80mph and whip blazes across swathes of arid land.\nThe state's largest wildfire in recent years was in San Diego county in 2003. That burned 273,246 acres, 2,820 buildings and led to 15 deaths.\nCalifornia's deadliest wildfire on record was also in southern California, according to Calfire. Twenty-nine people died in Los Angeles county in 1933.\nAnalysis by Vanessa Barford, BBC News in Los Angeles","summary":"A blazing wildfire in northern California has grown to 104 square miles, with nearly 600 homes destroyed.","id":"34261611"}

Not in terms of quality but in terms of endeavour and passion.\n\"The game was scrappy and bitty but Brazil wanted it that little bit more.

Yes, they gave away fouls, yes David Luiz was trying to put James Rodriguez off for the penalty, but if Brazil win this World Cup playing like that nobody will be bothered.\n\"If they lose, different story.\"\nBut Brazil will be without superstar and main striking hope Neymar, who has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebra after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga.\nThey will also be missing captain Thiago Silva, who is suspended after being booked.\nColombia had complaints of their own, chiefly the lack of protection offered to Rodriguez, who was on the receiving end of some fierce challenges as Brazil sought to nullify his influence.\nHe broke down in tears at the final whistle as he was consoled by the Brazil players who had offered him none of that commodity during a harrowing physical ordeal which proved he has the courage to go with his natural ability.\nBrazil and their supporters, in contrast, went wild with elation at the final whistle.

After a short delay, and some well-chosen words from Luiz, Rodriguez was calmness personified to send the keeper the wrong way.\nColombia threw everything forward in the last moments, but once again Brazil held on to seal the victory.\nBrazil v Germany will be live on BBC One on Tuesday, 8 July from 20:30 BST\nMatch ends, Brazil 2, Colombia 1.\nSecond Half ends, Brazil 2, Colombia 1.\nRamires (Brazil) wins a free kick on the right wing.\nFoul by Cristian Zapata (Colombia).\nAttempt missed.

{"document":"The EU's new Sentinel-2a satellite has the capability to look into the water column, to see whether reefs are undergoing change.\nCurrent, anomalously high temperatures are driving a huge coral bleaching event across the globe.\nEarly work suggests the Sentinel can detect the effects from 780km up.\nThe satellite's two images on this page show Fatu Huku Island in French Polynesia.\nThe one below is a full colour view of the 1.5km-long rocky outcrop.\nAt the top of the page, however, is a picture that displays only the \"blue band\" from the satellite's camera.\nSelecting this 490-nanometre wavelength makes the submerged reef around Fatu Huku jump out.\n\"The blue band really goes into the water. The shorter the wavelength, the better the penetration you have,\" explained Dr Benjamin Koetz from the European Space Agency (Esa).\n\"With Sentinel-2a, we can see 10-15m into the water, which you just couldn't see if you were using the green band, for example,\" he told BBC News.\nEsa is sponsoring a project called Sen2Coral, which had Sentinel-2a make repeat observations of the volcanic island from February to April this year.\nIn that time, it detected a change in sea-bottom radiance - a brightening - that is very likely related to bleaching.\nA dedicated field team sent to the island at the end of February confirmed that sea-water temperatures were consistently above 30C and that parts of the reef were stressed. More work is needed though to confirm the associations.\nExcessively warm water will cause coral polyps to expel their symbiotic algae. This drains a reef of its colour. It is not necessarily fatal but it can weaken the ecosystem, making it vulnerable in the face of other threats such as disease.\nBleaching has been occurring globally on a large scale of late because of the El Nino phenomenon, which sees surface temperatures spike in many ocean regions but particularly in the central and eastern Pacific.\nScientists had previously tried to observe corals in the same way as at Fatu Huku using the American Landsat spacecraft and the French Spot platform. The former does not have quite the resolution needed (just 30m versus S2a's 10m), and the latter's camera does not have the optimal band to penetrate the water column.\nUltimately, if the S2a techniques can be fully validated, it should be possible to automate the detection of change at reefs.\nScientists could then use the Sentinel to alert them, not just to possible bleaching but to other deleterious impacts such as pollution incidents and nutrient run-off from land.\nThe EU satellite is ideally suited to this kind of application. It is designed to map all land surfaces (and the coastal regions where corals tend to live) every 10 days. When its sister satellite (Sentinel-2b) is launched next year, this repeat time will fall to five days. All the data is free and open.\n\"Sentinel coverage is systematic in the sense that it covers within 20km of the coast. But this doesn't, of course, include all the corals in the world, and one of the objectives of this project is to try to understand what exactly is needed,\" said Dr Koetz.\n\"If we wanted to have a systematic coral reef observatory, we would have to increase the image acquisition plan, to take in all of the Great Barrier Reef, for example.\"\nThe coral work of Sentinel-2a was highlighted at Esa's Living Planet Symposium which took place in Prague earlier this month.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","summary":"Scientists are working on techniques that would allow them to routinely monitor the health of corals worldwide from orbit.","id":"36368064"}

{"document":"I'm scared because there is also a clock counting down in the bottom right-hand corner so something important must be about to happen like the arrival of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse but it turns out Shaun Batt has joined Leyton Orient from Millwall instead. On loan.\nWelcome to Transfer Deadline Day, which I've deliberately written in capitals because there are those who think we should make it a public holiday.\nChaotic and stressful and full of panic buying, Transfer Deadline Day and the window that precedes it make up football's equivalent of the Yuletide season, with Sky Sports' Jim White playing its equivalent of Santa. \"Sorry, no joy with Fabregas, I brought you Fellaini instead.\"\nA magnificent irony of transfer windows is that they were introduced in 2002-03 in part to stabilise the game.\nIt's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs\nTransfer windows were part of a compromise deal between football authorities and the European Commission, with the sport insisting on contractual stability for players, and clubs investing in those players, in exchange for freedom of movement at prescribed times of the year.\nYet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States.\nBut here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday.\nIn contrast, Transfer Deadline Days involve an awful lot of acquisitions across an unlevel playing field that often change nothing, but still generate enough hot air to make it seem as if they might.\n\"It's a period of time that is false and everything during that period of time is forced,\" says Gary Johnson, manager of Championship side Yeovil.\n\"Everybody has a little panic for the simple reason that the supporters demand a big name, or at least hope for one, and some of this is driven by the media. But for smaller clubs it's very difficult to get someone in that people can gasp at.\"\nIt is difficult to find a manager who is a fan of transfer windows, whether they manage in the Premier League or the lower reaches of the Football League.\nIan Holloway, who managed Blackpool and, briefly, Crystal Palace in the Premier League, reckons transfer windows are \"utter madness\" and lead to \"the headlong hurtling into deals to rescue dreams\".\n\"They encourage knee-jerk reactions, inflated transfer fees and wages and minimal planning and background checks,\" adds Holloway, who parted company with Palace in October and is now at Millwall.\nJohnson, whose side sit second from bottom in the Championship table, spends his Januarys being assailed by hordes of agents hawking players he had never heard of. Like a tourist in an exotic flea market, he usually ends up with something he doesn't really know what to do with.\n\"You don't want to miss anyone,\" said Johnson. \"So you look them up on the computer, find out what they can and can't do. But players with good character are unbelievably difficult to get.\"\nOther managers of smaller clubs lucky enough to have coveted players on their books see transfer windows as tantamount to restraint of trade.\nThe Premier League's counter argument is that either you have contractual stability for players and the squad stability that brings, or you have players being sacked at the drop of a hat or leaving at the drop of a wallet, to borrow a phrase from former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein.\nHowever, Holloway believes the old system, whereby clubs were allowed to buy and sell players up until and including the third week in March, was a more stable one, in that it allowed clubs to formulate long-term strategies away from the media and fan frenzy that constitutes a transfer window.\nCritics of the January window point to Harry Redknapp's maniacal spending spree last year, when the then recently appointed QPR boss paid more than Â£20m for Loic Remy and Chris Samba, as evidence that long-term strategies become secondary to short-term fantasies during football's silly season. QPR were relegated a few months later.\nMeanwhile, League Managers' Association chief executive Richard Bevan argues that so many managers are being sacked during the January transfer window and the weeks leading up to it because twitchy owners are unwilling to hand their money over to someone who is perceived to be failing.\nIn addition, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the system causes unrest in the dressing room, in that an out-of-favour player might spend from November to the end of January agitating for a move, or going through the motions for fear of suffering an injury and scuppering a possible move, or worrying that they are about to be supplanted by a new signing and losing motivation as a result.\nWenger, however, has no compunction about causing unrest in rival teams' dressing rooms, having upset Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a late bid for midfielder Yohan Cabaye last August.\nThe Premier League argues that a smart manager is one who is best able to deal with all these dressing room kerfuffles and play with the cards they were dealt at the start of the season.\nWenger's main complaint has always been with the January window in particular, which he believes distorts the competitive balance midway through a season. Why, asks Wenger, should a club be able to buy their way out of trouble at the expense of a poorer club which had their house in order before the season started?\nWenger's argument is moot for two reasons. First, the old system meant rich clubs were able to run riot with their cheque books for most of the season, not just in January. Second, the January window is effectively a sop to the European Commission and its directives on freedom of movement.\nAs it is, players' union Fifpro claims the current regulations impede players' freedom of movement and is preparing to challenge the system in the European courts.\nAnd while some fans will be of the opinion that well-remunerated players don't deserve the same rights as the rest of us and should take their 50 grand a week and stop complaining, other fans will find it bizarre that footballers, many of them on modest salaries, have fewer rights than other workers.\nWenger does have a point in his criticism of the timing of the summer transfer window. As it stands, the window closes two weeks after the start of the season, meaning a player might play two or three games for one club before being poached by another.\n\"The first game of the season would be a good time to close it,\" says Redknapp. \"Then we could all concentrate on the football.\"\nThe present system was introduced ahead of the 2002-03 season, as part of a compromise with the European Commission.\nThere are two transfer windows each season.\nThe first one for English football commences on 1 July and usually ends at 23:00 BST on 31 August.\nThe second transfer window begins at midnight on 31 December and ends at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, or the first working day after that date.\nBefore the introduction of the transfer window, players could be traded throughout the season up until 31 March.\nEach national football federation has its own registration period, so international transfers can take place if the window in the country of the buying club is still open.\nFree agents can be signed at any time during the season as long as they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.\nSource: Premier League\nThe difficulty of co-ordinating the transfer window in England with other European leagues is the principal reason why the summer window has not been moved forward.\nBut another reason is that the media and football fans, unlike Redknapp, do not want to concentrate solely on the football. They want to concentrate on Redknapp chatting with reporters about the transfer window through the window of his Range Rover.\nWhen transfer windows were introduced, they were seen as potentially damaging for the red tops, for which transfer tittle-tattle was a staple. But the British media have adapted, turning transfer windows into feeding frenzies for football fans of a dramatic persuasion. Which is most of them.\nLast January, disaffected (you read that word a lot in the football pages in January) West Bromwich Albion striker Peter Odemwingie was spotted outside Loftus Road on Transfer Deadline Day, caught in the act of trying to force through a move to QPR off his own bat.\nThe Odemwingie Fiasco, as it came to be known, had some of the ingredients of a caper movie: brinksmanship, silliness, adventure and audacity, as well as the comedy of embarrassment. And the British media milked it for all it was worth.\nAnd it is in January, when few Premier League powerhouses do big business because of players' involvement in European competition and many trades in the Football League consist of low-key loans, that the British media really excels, making fans believe there is a mega signing lurking around every corner.\n\"All we're trying to do is nick players here and there,\" says Gary Johnson, exposing the unglamorous truth for the majority of Football League clubs.\n\"It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs.\"\nWho knows which players will find their way to Yeovil this Transfer Deadline Day. But if anyone does, it will be a case of ignore the football and feel the superlatives.

{"document":"There are growing divisions in the right-wing party over Mr Orban's steps to turn Hungary into an \"illiberal democracy\", despite a third election victory this year:\nEven though a majority of Hungarians oppose their policies - 2.8 million against to 2.3 million in favour in April -  opposition parties are weak and divided, with the exception of the radical nationalist Jobbik movement, which has emerged as the main rival to Fidesz.\nBut the mood in the corridors of power is wretched. In a country where backbench rebellions are almost unknown, politicians contend themselves with hints of dissent in anti-government media, and more open attacks on Viktor Orban's policies in pro-government media.\nA new, pro-Russian foreign policy sits particularly awkwardly in a party which rose to fame in 1989 as the first to demand publicly that Soviet troops leave Hungary.\nIt began with a photograph of Viktor Orban shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January, after signing a highly controversial nuclear expansion deal.\nWhen the Russians annexed Crimea in March, the Budapest government criticised the beleaguered Ukrainian government in Kiev, and stated publicly that all it cared about was the Hungarian minority in western Ukraine.\nIn July, Hungary's embassy in Estonia was closed down at a moment when the Baltic states - Hungary's Nato allies - felt under most pressure from Moscow.\nMr Orban has consistently opposed EU and US sanctions against Russia, on the grounds that \"we should be doves in economic policy, and hawks in defence\".\nIn an August speech to Hungary's ambassadors, he called openly for an unprincipled foreign policy, placing foreign investment in Hungary above any moral considerations such as a trade partner's human rights record.\nAnd in September, within an hour of Mr Orban meeting with the chief of Russia's state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, the reverse flow of gas to Ukraine in Hungary's pipelines, which had been annoying Russia, was stopped.\nDismay is growing within Fidesz at his domestic policy too: at government corruption, the playboy lifestyle of numerous party officials, and an economic policy which consistently suppresses the value of the Hungarian currency, the forint.\nThere is also increasing rivalry between the oligarchs: the rich men who fund the party from behind the scenes, on a model learnt from the former communists.\n\"Unprincipled decisions cause harm, even if that is not visible in the short term,\" parliament speaker Laszlo Kover, a founding member of Fidesz and close friend of Mr Orban said in August in the main pro-government weekly newspaper.\nThis was in reply to a question on the rise of communist-era secret service loyalists and businessmen with offshore accounts in government ranks.\nThe editor of the same weekly, Gabor Borokai, himself a former Fidesz government spokesman, lambasted what he called a \"self-assured and arrogant social group\" of young Fidesz leaders who believed they were beyond the law. This was apparently a reference to 36-year-old Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and his friends.\nAnother intra-Fidesz dispute has broken out over the extensive power of Janos Lazar, 39, the minister in charge of Mr Orban's office, who is responsible for the daily running of the government.\nOther Fidesz officials, led by the head of the parliamentary group, increasingly regard Mr Lazar as a reckless and dangerous figure.\n\"From Hungary to Egypt, endless regulations and overt intimidation increasingly target civil society,\" US President Barack Obama said in September. This followed a government investigation into non-governmental organisations partially-funded by Norway, over alleged financial mismanagement.\nThe latest insult to split Fidesz came last week when the US government banned six unnamed Hungarian public officials from visiting the United States.\nWhile the most hysterical pro-government commentators called for revenge, investigative reporters suggested that the head of the Hungarian tax authority was on the list for trying to bribe US businessmen.\nThat was followed this week by anger at a new government plan to tax internet use.\n\"Orban's illiberal democracy is the expression of a power structure where all powerÃ¢â¬Â¦ resides at the centre,\" says Peter Rona, an Oxford-based economist and former member of the supervisory board of the Hungarian National Bank.\nUnlike almost all other commentators, however, he can see an end to Fidesz's rule.\nHungarian governments are traditionally brought down by the misguided policies of their central bankers.\nAnd Mr Rona thinks Fidesz could fall too because the determination of national bank head Gyorgy Matolcsy, a former Orban minister, to keep the forint weak at all costs.","summary":"Hungarians are commemorating the anniversary of their 1956 revolution against Soviet rule but many senior figures in the ruling Fidesz party believe Prime Minister Viktor Orban is steering the country back to its authoritarian past.","id":"29740030"}

{"document":"Action on Junk Food Marketing analysed 750 adverts shown during the X Factor on ITV and the Simpsons and Hollyoaks on Channel 4 over 20 hours.\nIt found one in 10 promoted fast food restaurants, confectionery or supermarket 'junk food'.\nBut the government said advertising was not to blame for childhood obesity.\nThe analysis, which was carried out by researchers at the University of Liverpool, found that unhealthy food items accounted for 11% of all adverts and around half of all food adverts.\nThey said the most frequently shown adverts for unhealthy food products came from supermarkets such as Aldi and Morrisons, followed by fast food chains such as Dominos and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).\nChocolate manufacturers like Lindt and Cadbury and brands such as Clover and Flora Buttery were also included on the \"unhealthy\" ads list.\nThe researchers looked at adverts shown during 10 hours of X Factor programmes and another 10 hours of early evening Channel 4 programmes during the run-up to Christmas 2013.\nThe campaign group Action on Junk Food Marketing, whose members include the Children's Food Campaign and the British Heart Foundation, said children's TV viewing peaks around 20:00 but laws to protect children from targeted advertising only cover children's programmes, which tend to be broadcast earlier in the day.\nSimon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Parents don't expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime TV, but that's exactly what happens.\n\"Even when the show is over, junk food marketers could be reaching out to young people online. A lack of regulation means companies are free to lure kids into playing games and entering competitions - all with a view to pushing their product.\"\nProf Mitch Blair, officer for health promotion at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said advertising junk food during family-friendly programmes like the X Factor is known to work.\n\"Not only are children and young people easily influenced and parents worn down by pester power, but food companies wouldn't spend huge amounts of money if it wasn't effective.\"\nCampaigners want the ban on \"junk food\" advertising to be extended to 21:00.\n\"Children should not be commercially exploited and the advertising industry must take some responsibility for helping tackle the growing problem of childhood obesity,\" Prof Blair said.\nThe government said advertising was just one aspect in determining children's choice of food and one part of the package aimed at tackling childhood obesity and poor diet. It added that it was keeping \"this area under review\".\nThe Advertising Association went further saying the report was \"lobbying dressed up as science\" and the current rules on advertising were working.\nCommunications director Ian Barber added: \"The UK's evidenced-based approach to the advertising rules works, balancing sensible protections with the freedom to advertise, allowing companies to compete - to the benefit of us all - and providing important funding for free-to-air TV.\"\nBut there is general agreement that with around one-third of UK children now overweight or obese, encouraging families and children to eat healthier diets is important.\nDr Alison Tedstone, director of diet and obesity at Public Health England, said they were working with the food industry to promote healthier products on TV through their Change4Life campaign.\n\"We recognise that we are all influenced by food adverts on TV.

In a statement this month, Platini said \"the remuneration was agreed at the time\".\nIt is understood the men claimed an agreement to delay payment was reached at the time due to Fifa's then financial position.\nUnder Swiss law, an employee cannot seek to have a contract paid up after five years have elapsed irrespective of whether it was written or oral.\nBoth men have denied any wrongdoing, have appealed against their bans and believe they will be exonerated.\nUefa, which meets in Nyon on Thursday to discuss the issue, has said it has \"full confidence\" in its president and \"stands fully behind him\".\nHowever, one Uefa executive committee member, Allan Hansen, has been quoted by Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet as saying \"we can no longer support him\" - if no contract exists.\nMeanwhile, Fifa has banned Thai football chief and former executive member Worawi Makudi for 90 days for an ethics breach and indicated he could face further punishment.","summary":"Uefa chief Michel Platini produced no documentary evidence for the 2m Swiss francs (Â£1.35m) payment made to him by Fifa, the BBC has learned.","id":"34507539"}

{"document":"For many pundits the move comes as a surprise, because M-Pesa has been a huge success in other African states - especially in Kenya where it was launched in 2007.\nThe service allows people without bank accounts to transfer money quickly, easily and safely using their mobile phones.\nAccording to a World Bank report, only 12% of Africans with bank accounts use mobile money services.\nHowever, this is not the case in South Africa.\nMobile phone usage is high - nine in 10 South Africans own a mobile phone - and a third of these are smartphones, according to figures from the Pew Research Center.\nYet South Africa has the most technologically advanced, financially liquid and accessible banking system on the continent.\nAbout 75% of adults in the country have bank accounts, a survey done by technology research body FinMark shows.\nIn a statement, Vodacom Chief Executive Shameel Joosub said the success of M-Pesa in South Africa hinged on \"achieving a critical mass of users\".\nBut Vodacom has struggled to find the customers. That is the problem.\nM-Pesa was launched in South Africa in 2010, perhaps with the hope of capturing the energy and excitement of a nation hosting the football World Cup.\nTrading on its position as the leading mobile operator in the country, Vodacom thought it could build an M-Pesa customer base of 10 million in three years.\nHowever, six years on the service only has 76,000 active users in South Africa, although many more have been registered.\nM-Pesa: The mobile wallet\nSource: Vodacom\nJambo pesa! (Hello, money! in Swahili)\nA few reasons have been cited for its failure.\nVodacom had to partner with a bank to provide the financial service on its platform.\nNedbank was its choice - and although it is one of the largest banks in South Africa, the perception is that it caters for middle-class and high-income earners.\nThese customers already have an array of banking services and platforms through which to conduct their business.\nSouth Africa is also a country where banks have actually made significant inroads in both urban and rural areas.\nThough untested, it is said that there is a bank, branch or ATM within a 20km (12-mile) radius in any urban or rural settlement.\nSo the challenge in South Africa is not about access.\nRather it is the ability to use various technologies to support how people save, spend and invest their money.\nIn this regard, banks in the country are focused on developing new financial products that will enhance savings schemes and pension funds.\nMobile phone operators, on the other hand, are working towards opening more secure platforms - for instance linking banks, hospitals, retailers, insurers, municipalities and revenue services.\nThere is definitely still a case to be made for getting the unbanked population to open up accounts.\nAnd statistics show this is the trend.\nA 2015 KPMG report revealed that South African banks are growing at an annual rate of 7% and to date the industry has assets worth $361bn (ÃÂ£250bn).\nThe prospects for financial services are good.\nVodacom remains upbeat about the market in South Africa despite the failure of M-Pesa.\n\"We remain of the opinion that opportunities exist in the financial services environment and we will continue to explore these,\" Mr Joosub said\nBut the only real concern is the continued growth and stability of the South African economy.\nThe country has been facing severe economic storms caused by slow growth, a weakened currency, disinvestment in mining, factories closing down and unemployment on the rise.\nThese problems need to be tackled head-on, if communications, banking and services are to continue to thrive and create a new direction for this economy.\nAfrica Business Report is broadcast on BBC World News on Fridays at 16:40 GMT and 1840 GMT, on Saturdays at 1010 GMT and 1830 GMT and on Sundays at 0010 GMT.","summary":"South Africa's largest mobile phone operator Vodacom has announced it will be scrapping its M-Pesa mobile money transfer system in Africa's second-biggest economy.","id":"36260348"}

{"document":"Mr Swinney made the announcement as he unveiled his draft budget to MSPs in the Scottish Parliament.\nHe also announced a tax rise on many second homes and buy-to-let properties through a Land and Buildings Transaction Tax levy.\nAnd Mr Swinney confirmed that the council tax freeze would continue.\nThe finance secretary warned that the Scottish budget was set to continue to reduce in real terms until the end of the decade, as he said it had done since 2010.\nOpposition parties claimed that Mr Swinney was \"following where the Conservatives lead\" and that his budget would result in \"massive cuts\" to local services such as schools, roads and care of the elderly.\nAnd local authority body Cosla warned that funding going to Scotland's 32 councils had been cut by 3.5% - meaning they would lose out on Â£350m between them.\nHolyrood will be given limited powers over income tax rates next April under the 2012 Scotland Act, which was passed under the previous UK coalition government.\nIt will see the Treasury deduct from the Scottish block grant a sum equivalent to the product of 10p worth of income tax north of the border.\nMr Swinney then had the option of setting a Scottish Rate of Income Tax (SRIT) which could either be lower, higher or the same as the 10p that has been deducted.\nThe finance secretary told the Holyrood chamber: \"I propose that the Scottish Rate of Income Tax will be set at 10p in the pound - the rate people pay this year will be the same rate that they will pay next year.\n\"I hope that from 2017\/18 this parliament will have more flexibility in setting income tax rates. However, that will depend on reaching agreement on a new fiscal framework and final passage of the Scotland Bill.\"\nAmong the other measures proposed by Mr Swinney were:\nGreater controls over income tax are among the measures contained in the Scotland Bill which is currently being scrutinised by Westminster, but these will not come into force until 2017 at the earliest.\nMr Swinney said that the Scottish government aimed to set out its longer-term plans on income tax ahead of the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament in March of next year.\nHe said that the Scottish government's aim was to focus on tackling inequality and boosting productivity in order to \"create the foundations for a stronger and more inclusive economy\".\nBut he said that would need to be delivered within a \"significantly constrained\" public spending environment.\nMr Swinney added: \"By 2020 our budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms than when the Conservatives came to power. That is the equivalent of one pound in every eight that we spend being cut by Westminster by 2020.\"\nHe said that Land and Buildings Transaction tax, which replaced the stamp duty charge on property sales in Scotland, will remain the same for most transactions.\nBut he added: \"The exception to this is for buyers purchasing an additional residential property - such as a second home or a buy-to-let - worth more than Â£40,000, who will face an additional charge of 3% of the value.\nMr Swinney said this was \"proportionate and fair\", adding the new levy \"seeks to ensure that the opportunities for first-time buyers to enter the housing market in Scotland remain as strong as they possibly can be\".\nÂ£13bn\nfor 2016\/\/17\nÂ£500m additional spending for 2016\/17\n6.5% increase on 2015\/16\nHe also announced that he was allocating more than Â£500m to NHS budgets, which he said would result in total planned spending of nearly Â£13bn next year - an increase of 6.5% on the comparable figure for 2015\/16.\nBut he warned that Scotland's ageing population meant that additional funding alone was not enough to equip it properly for the future.\nMr Swinney added: \"To really protect our NHS, we need to do more than just give it extra money - we need to use that money to deliver fundamental reform and change the way our NHS delivers care.\"No change in Scottish income tax rate\nÂ£9,545m\nRevenue funding for the country's 32 councils\nÂ£250m - new money for health and social care\nÂ£70m - to continue the council tax freeze\nÂ£88m - to maintain teacher numbers at 2015 levels\nTo this end, he said an extra Â£45m would be invested in improvements to primary care, with a further Â£200m funding six new treatment centres.\nMr Swinney said: \"This will equip the NHS to carry out increased numbers of hip and knee replacements and cataract operations, in a way that does not simply add pressure to our emergency hospitals.\"\nThe draft budget is normally presented in September, but was delayed this year to take into account the Westminster spending review in November.\nBy BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor\nIn practice, John Swinney was holding steady in this budget - for understandable reasons. Firstly, there are big changes pending: reforming council tax, reviewing business rates, extra tax powers from the Smith Commission.\nAll that plus there is still no final deal on the Fiscal Framework which will accompany the Smith powers - although one is now firmly forecast for February.  All that adds up to a climate of arithmetical and political uncertainty.\nBut secondly there are elections to the Scottish Parliament in May. Mr Swinney does not lack fortitude but it would have taken a particularly courageous Finance Secretary (in the Yes Minister mode) to hike income tax, at the first time of asking under new powers, weeks before those polls.\nRead more analysis from Brian.\nScottish Labour's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"This is the most important budget since devolution, delivered by a party who promised to stand up for Scotland against Tory austerity.\n\"But it doesn't deliver fairer taxes, a long-term plan for Scotland or an anti-austerity alternative. Local services like our schools, roads and care of the elderly will face massive cuts.\"\nMurdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives said Mr Swinney had chosen not to increase the resources available to him by levying additional taxes.\nHe added: \"For years, the finance secretary has portrayed himself as a prisoner of Westminster austerity, but now that he has been given the key to the door of his cell, he has decided not to use it.\n\"So I trust we will hear no more from the SNP about austerity and Westminster cuts, when the party itself has made the choice not to increase the size of the budget available.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney \"has spent his entire political life campaigning for more tax powers. And what does he do when he gets them? The answer is nothing, no change, same rate and the same as in England.\n\"John Swinney cannot tell Scotland that he is rejecting austerity when he is not raising a penny more even though he has the new tax powers to do something about it.\"\nCosla president David O'Neill said the cuts to council funding \"cannot be laid at Westminster's door this time around\".\nHe added: \"A cut of 3.5% is catastrophic for jobs and services within Scottish local government - because the harsh reality is that it actually translates to real job cuts that hit real families, in real communities throughout Scotland.

{"document":"This has been a gruelling week for the primates of the Anglican Communion: 39 of them in total meeting for a make or break gathering, spending several days living, eating, praying and negotiating together in Canterbury over the future of the world's third biggest Christian grouping.\nThe meeting saw high stakes diplomacy by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and his team, as the already fissiparous Communion threatened to split apart over the issue of same sex marriage.\nThe primates were kept well away from the glare of the media as the delicate talks got under way.\nThis was in the knowledge that comments in the public domain could prompt a walkout by the most traditionalist nations, who are part of Global Anglican Future (GAFCON) - a potential rival leadership should the Anglican Communion divide on this issue.\nTheir resolution was leaked on Thursday.\nIt shows that they have agreed that by recognising same-sex marriage, the Episcopal Church in the US departed fundamentally from the faith and teaching of the Anglican Communion on the doctrine of marriage.\nThe church will now be suspended from participating in the life and work of the Anglican Communion.\nThe resolution stated that there were no victors and no vanquished.\nBut LGBTi Christians and others are bitterly disappointed by the result and had hoped to see more support from the more liberal churches.\nIn the end, though, it seems that the Anglican Communion as a whole valued unity over diversity.\nAnd there was clear strength of feeling at the meeting that for the vast majority of Anglicans represented there, marriage remains between a man and a woman, for life - even if secular societies in the west have moved rapidly over the past few years towards recognising equal or same sex marriage after years of similarly heated debate over the issue.\nSo what does the resolution mean?\nIt is clearly a shot across the bows for any other Anglican churches that may be thinking about changing doctrine unilaterally.\nThe Anglican Church of Canada, for example, takes a similar position on homosexuality to the Episcopal Church, though it has not yet formally endorsed services of same sex marriage.\nMany of the provinces represented in Canterbury this week are having their own discussions about sexuality and whether to bless same sex unions in the future.\nThis is an issue that will not go away, even if the primates would like it to.\nThe Church of England itself is holding shared conversations on sexuality, in which LGBTi supporters and opponents are meant to share their views (although some participants have been critical of the reality).\nIn the end, the action taken over the Episcopal Church will not have a major impact on its congregations.\nHowever, it will make many LGBTi supporters and those in favour of equality for all congregants question the Anglican Communion's claim to represent a loving church.\nAlthough the deal represents a major achievement in keeping the Communion together, it remains extremely fragile.\nAnd quite what walking together at a distance means in practice will be tested over the next three years.\nTraditionalists will not be reconciled to same sex marriage, but nor will LGBTi Anglicans and their allies be ready to accept inequality indefinitely.\nThe power battle over who should lead the Communion in the future ÃÂ­with congregations growing in the global south, especially in Africa, even as they decline in the west, means that this is more of a stay of execution than a permanent reprieve for the Communion.\nIt is likely to find itself returning to exactly these themes at the next Lambeth Conference, the date of which could even be announced later.","summary":"As Anglican leaders bar a liberal US branch from decision-making for allowing same-sex marriage, the BBC's religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt considers what this means for the Anglican Church.","id":"35326234"}

That cannot continue for an extended period, for much longer.\n\"I've already had to make certain statements over the budget to ensure that civil servants are able to do their job, so yes, it is about that focus on what now needs to happen.\"\nWhen the parties missed a government deadline on Thursday, the secretary of state extended the talks over the weekend, in the hope that a deal will be struck by Monday, when he is due to make a statement on Stormont's future.\nEarlier, Sinn FÃ©in called for the British and Irish prime ministers to become directly involved in the talks process.\nThe party said the DUP had not moved on a number of issues, including an Irish language act, same-sex marriage, a Bill of Rights and measures to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.\nSinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said it was a \"source of frustration\" there had been no closing of the gap between the parties throughout the day.\nHe claimed that the DUP \"haven't yet accepted what brought down the institutions in the first place\".\nBut the DUP's Christopher Stalford said Sinn FÃ©in had presented a \"shopping list\" of demands and was refusing to go back into government until they had received every item on their list.\nHis party colleague, Edwin Poots, rejected a call for the prime ministers to get involved and said Sinn FÃ©in knows what is required and \"don't need anyone to hold their hands\".\nMr Poots said Thursday's missed deadline meant Stormont was now \"operating on a 95% budget, which is essentially a 5% cut across all of the departments\".\nThe DUP MLA described this as \"far greater austerity than any Conservative ever imposed upon the Northern Ireland public\".\n\"Whilst we understand that Irish language is hugely important to Sinn FÃ©in - health, education, jobs, the economy, infrastructure, environment, agriculture - all of these issues are hugely important to us, hugely important to the public,\" Mr Poots said.\nResponding to his remarks, Mr Murphy said: \"The DUP are in absolutely no position to lecture anyone in relation to the provision of public services.\"\nThe Sinn FÃ©in MLA accused DUP MPs of voting for a measure in the Queen's Speech \"which will effectively remove and reduce public sector wages\".\nEarlier, his Sinn FÃ©in colleague John O'Dowd said there must be a \"step change\" for talks to succeed.\n\"As co-guarantor of the agreements, it is time for the British Prime Minister Theresa May and the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar to take direct responsibility.\"\nMr O'Dowd also said the DUP's \"confidence and supply\" deal with the Conservatives had \"emboldened and entrenched\" their views, making the prospect of a deal less likely.\nA Downing Street spokesperson said that the secretary of state was on the ground in Belfast and would continue to engage intensively with the parties on Friday and over the weekend.\n\"The prime minister has met with all five parties and will continue to have close engagement with the Northern Ireland secretary and the taoiseach, who she spoke with earlier this weekend,\" they added.\nThe secretary of state has the option of giving the parties more time to negotiate, calling another assembly election or reintroducing direct rule from Westminster.\nThe independent chair of the talks process, Sir Malcolm McKibbin, formally retired on Friday as head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.\nHowever, parties asked him to stay on as chair to steer the negotiations.\nWhile we've bust through another deadline, it's a deadline that theoretically still exists.\nSo, Secretary of State James Brokenshire is under responsibility to set a date for a fresh assembly election.\nHowever, everybody is expecting he will consider his options and come through with an emergency law to either allow for yet another deadline or move towards to some form of direct rule.\nThe mood music around Stormont hasn't been particularly favourable.\nI don't get any kind of immediate sense that the parties are going to come up with an ingenious compromise.\nUnder the deal signed in Downing Street on Monday, the minority Conservative government can rely on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs to get legislation through the House of Commons.\nCritics of the deal have questioned whether the Westminster government can act with impartiality between unionists and Irish nationalists when it is dependent on the support of the DUP.\nConservative MP Laurence Robertson told the BBC's The View programme that Mr Brokenshire would \"weigh it up over the weekend\" but added he did not believe there was any appetite for another snap assembly election.\nMr Robertson chaired Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for two terms from 2010 until the Dissolution of Parliament in May this year.\nHe told the programme that Stormont could not \"keep stumbling from crisis to crisis\" but added he hoped Northern Ireland was not heading for a prolonged period of direct rule.\n\"I sincerely hope not, I was a shadow minister when we had the last period of direct rule and very important issues are decided upstairs in the House of Commons, in a committee of 20 MPs.\n\"That's no way to run Northern Ireland so I sincerely hope not.\n\"But, somebody has to run the province, so if that's what Sinn FÃ©in are forcing, well, that might be the only option.\"\nHowever, Mr Robertson said he did not think his party's agreement with the DUP was causing the problem, because Stormont's latest crisis had happened \"long before\" the deal.\n\"I think it's a problem within Sinn FÃ©in,\" the Tory MP said.\n\"I don't know what game they are playing, but I do know it's a dangerous one.\"\nNorthern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government for almost six months.\nIts institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in about a botched green energy scheme.\nThe late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, stood down in protest over the DUP's handling of an investigation into the scandal, in a move that triggered a snap election in March.","summary":"The absence of devolved government in Northern Ireland \"cannot continue for much longer,\" Secretary of State James Brokenshire has said.","id":"40451181"}

{"document":"Right now, prices are around 60% down on July 2014. Supply has outstripped demand - great news for motorists but a disaster for the UK oil industry.\nAround 65,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost, many of them in Aberdeen.\nIt is not the first time a glut of cheap oil has given British businesses a battering. But 150 years ago it was not the North Sea that bore the brunt of the downturn - it was north Wales.\nIn the second half of the 19th Century, Flintshire struck oil.\nStrictly speaking, it struck cannel coal - a dense, smooth, shale-like variety of coal which can be distilled to make oil.\nWhile that admittedly sounds a lot less thrilling than the discovery of a black gold \"gusher\" under the Flintshire hills, it nevertheless heralded a global investment frenzy to rival the early days of the California gold rush.\nSpeculators ploughed close to a million pounds into a variety of coal-oil ventures from Mold to Queensferry.\nThe vast majority of them were to lose their shirts.\n\"It must have been absolutely astounding,\" said Dr Robin Chesters, Director of the Museum of the Scottish Shale Oil Industry, which has conducted extensive research into the Flintshire \"oil-dorado\".\n\"It all happened so fast that some of the oil works weren't actually completed and others were put together so quickly that they began to fall down.\"\nThe seeds of the oil rush were sown in 1858 when an industrialist named Ebenezer Waugh Fernie discovered an exceptionally rich seam of cannel coal at Leeswood Green Colliery, near Mold.\nSeven years earlier the Scottish scientist James \"Paraffin\" Young had patented his process of producing oil from coal and established a highly successful oil works at Bathgate in West Lothian.\nFernie suspected there was similar money to be made in Leeswood and he set about building an oil works near the colliery.\nBut the budding enterprise was hampered by Young's patent and Fernie's numerous attempts at surreptitious oil production landed him in court.\nThe \"Great Paraffine Case\" was brought before the Chancery court in London in January 1864. It lasted 33 days, called 73 witnesses and became a cause celebre.\nThe court found in Young's favour and awarded him substantial damages. But his patent expired a few months later anyway,\nThat, together with the huge amount of publicity garnered by the case, meant that Flintshire's cannel coal reserves were suddenly ripe for the distilling.\n\"People who had been reading about this great court case and all the money that could be made realised that they could now go into the business and make their fortune,\" said Dr Chesters.\nWould-be oil tycoons from all over Britain and abroad began ploughing money into coal-oil companies.\nA total of 26 oil works and refineries were built in Flintshire, mainly near the collieries where the cannel coal was mined.\nPeople flocked to the area from far and wide in search of work, rents were raised exorbitantly and overcrowding was rife.\nBy late 1865, oil fever had Flintshire in its grip.\nAn account published in the Western Daily Press in November of that year describes the frenzied activity at the height of the boom:\n\"I pushed for Padeswood, a small station about two miles from Mold, in Flintshire, and landed at once in the very heart of the mineral oil region.\n\"T'was as if I had fallen asleep in the train at Chester, and woke up amongst the \"Oil Wells\" at Pennsylvania.\n\"There was the identical mud, about the same quantity of smell, the same run of land, the same rough people, the same sort of fires and furnaces, cauldrons, retorts, kettles, stew-pans for oil and distilleries.\"\n\"There was a mad rush for cannel,\" says another report in the Oil Trade Review.\n\"Leases of property known to contain cannel were transferred at enormous premiums and every other holding of land not known to contain cannel was bored in all directions in the hope of finding it.\n\"The little town of Mold became suddenly so important that the inhabitants of the neighbouring city began to consider whether it might not soon become desirable to describe themselves as living in 'a place called Chester, near Mold'.\"\nBut the boom proved to be short-lived. Just 18 months after the Flintshire oil stampede had begun, the industry was on its knees and cheap US imports were to blame.\n\"The first oil had come from America in around 1859,\" said Dr Chesters.\n\"But from 1861, the Civil War disrupted all of the North Atlantic trade and that meant that very limited supplies were coming through.\n\"But as soon as the Flintshire industry really began to get into its stride, the Civil War ended and imports started up again.\n\"The whole price of oil dropped tremendously and what looked like a good industry to invest in in early 1865, became totally unviable part way through 1866.\"\nOver the next couple of years, most of the oil companies were shut down and local newspapers were full of tales of would be oil-barons facing bankruptcy and ruin.\nAn 1869 article in the Oil Trade Review paints a gloomy picture: \"Dilapidated brickwork, smokeless stunted chimneys and other ruins of manufacturing operations are now the subject of melancholy comment by visitors who formerly were lost in wonderment at the sudden development of its commercial prosperity.\"\nBut while its impact on the local area was immense, the story of the Flintshire oil rush remains obscure.\nWritten accounts are all that remains.\nOne in particular - by Arthur Robottom, a Birmingham merchant who invested in the Coppa Oil company, near Mold - sums up the high hopes and broken dreams of that extraordinary time: \"The steam yachts, carriages, mansions and other luxuries that we had been awarding ourselves in the future all faded away like a dream.\n\"All of my plans had collapsed with a suddenness that nearly drove me to despair and I began to think that it would be well that I should never again make too sure of anything.\"","summary":"The tumbling price of oil has been headline news for months.","id":"35634837"}

But he doesn't fit the stereotype of a brash property developer.  He is aware of the tensions development can create.\n\"Gentrification has to be seen from two angles,\" he says.\n\"Of course, the first is that of the tenant.\n\"In Berlin, when the prices rise, people feel insecure.\n\"On the other hand, gentrification also means change and progress.\n\"And even if it's unpleasant for some, it remains very important for the city that investment comes in.\"\nIn many ways, Berlin is still a city of two halves.\nOn the one hand, there is an incredibly fast-growing community of hi-tech start-ups.\nOn the other, the city's unemployment rate is more than 10%, compared with just 6% for the rest of Germany.\nMichael Plaumann lives in a homeless shelter in Neukoelln, an area earmarked by developers as the next property hotspot.\nTo supplement his unemployment benefit, he sells a homeless newspaper on the trains of Berlin.\n\"It's very difficult for me to find my own apartment for myself,\" he says.\n\"That's why I've been living in a shelter for a while already, because the apartments have become very expensive, and for as someone who receives benefits, it is just too expensive.\"\nThe $900 (ÃÂ£600) cost of his shelter accommodation is covered by his benefits.\nShould he find an apartment of this own, he'd be unable to claim the full rent because of a cap, which could price him out of his neighbourhood.\n\"I want to live in my neighbourhood.

{"document":"Baby cheetahs are so prized as exotic pets that entire litters are seized from their mothers when they may only be four to six weeks old.\nEach tiny animal can fetch as much as $10,000 on the black market and end up being paraded on social media by wealthy buyers in Gulf states.\nBut the trade exacts a terrible toll on a species that claims a superlative status as the fastest land animal on the planet but which now faces a serious threat to its survival.\nAccording to the Cheetah Conservation Fund, some 1,200 cheetah cubs are known to have been trafficked out of Africa over the past 10 years but a shocking 85% of them died during the journey.\nDr Laurie Marker, the trust's director, describes the horrific conditions involved in shipping the animals from their habitats in northern Kenya, Somaliland and Ethiopia by land and sea to the Arabian Gulf.\n\"They're probably just thrown into a crate, living in their own faeces, travelling for days without proper food, and many of them end up dead on arrival at wherever that place would be, and maybe one or two living out of a pile that are dead.\"\nAnd those that do make it into the hands of new owners usually die rapidly because they are denied the chance to exercise and are given an inadequate diet.\nDr Marker says that they're often kept in \"chicken coop-sized pens\" which are far too small for them.\n\"And this is an animal that is the fastest land animal that is used to living in huge home ranges of 800 sq km. Most of those cheetahs don't make it over a two-year period of time in captivity.\"\nWith the total of adult cheetahs living in the wild now numbering less than 7,000, the concern is that seizures of an estimated 200-300 a year could drive some of the remaining populations, which are already diminished, to extinction.\nThe poaching comes on top of the long-running destruction of the cheetahs' habitats. The animals tend not to thrive in the confines of national parks where other predators dominate, so they live outside protected areas and are more exposed to conflict with people.\nThe threat to the cheetah will be raised at the CITES COP17 conference being held in Johannesburg over the next fortnight.\nOne criticism of the conservation movement is that it has recently been doing a better job highlighting the plight of the giants of African wildlife, the elephants and the rhinos, compared with other iconic species whose existence is equally at risk.\nAs a vet working in Kuwait, Jill Mullen saw for herself how easily cheetah cubs were imported despite the existence of controls under the CITES convention.\nNow back in the UK, she told me how her surgery would see as many as six cubs in a single day. All of them would be suffering from dehydration, malnutrition and a common virus known as panleukopenia against which the cubs have no immunity.\nUsually, only one of the six would survive.\n\"I would stand on the soapbox to explain to the owners why it was wrong to have these animals as pets, that they're endangered in the wild, and are not designed to be kept in living rooms and in villas.\n\"But in the end I had to swallow the feeling that everything was wrong because that was my job.\"\nMs Mullen found that most owners did not know about the CITES restrictions or care about them.\n\"You have the car and the boat but nothing tops having an exotic pet and, if they can buy it, it doesn't matter about the legality.\"\nDuring her time in Kuwait, there was an attempt by the authorities to clamp down, and vets like her were banned from handling cheetahs and other endangered animals. But she believes this drove the trade underground.\nOn the agenda in Johannesburg is a quest to raise awareness in buyer countries of the dangers the trade poses to the cheetah.\nOne idea is to persuade internet platforms to join the fight - many carry social media pictures taken by cheetah owners showing off their animals. Others allow dealers to offer cheetah cubs for sale.\nAnother initiative is to draw up plans for how to handle cheetahs if they are confiscated - if the authorities do get tough, large numbers may suddenly need to be housed.\nAlready when cheetahs become too big, or their owners find that they cannot care for them, the animals are released into the streets and found dead or weakened.\nBut there is a sense that time is not on the side of a species whose very fame may be the cause of its demise.\nAs Dr Marker puts it, \"the cheetah is running the most important race of its life, and that's for its very survival and its survival is in human hands\".","summary":"Pitiful scenes of cheetah cubs lying emaciated and bewildered highlight one of the cruellest but least-publicised examples of illegal wildlife trafficking.","id":"37452304"}

{"document":"Is the new popularity of anti-EU parties in the UK, France, Greece and Spain a hangover from the crash of 2007-8, the euro crisis of 2010-13 and long years of squeezed living standards - a protest from those who feel dispossessed in an economic sense?\nOr does the surge of UKIP, the Front National and Syriza, inter alia, reflect a more profound sense that the mainstream parties and conventional political institutions no longer serve the interests of millions of people?\nIs it \"the economy, stupid\", or is it \"globalisation and a dysfunctional EU, stupid\"?\nThe answer matters.\nMaybe the economy is easier to fix - although not necessarily in the eurozone, which still lacks the requisite cross-border political solidarity that would allow the excessive debt burden to be pooled, and its growth-deadening impact to be mitigated.\nAs for the UK, it is possible that the current economic recovery will suddenly translate into a significant rise in living standards, that has been so elusive for six years. But the prime minister might not be best advised to count on it.\nA significant microcosm of both the problem and the solution is London - where, significantly, UKIP resonated less and performed less well than elsewhere.\nPart of the explanation is that globalisation - which gives many a sense that they have little direct control over their economic destiny - enriches London.\nMuch of the rest of the UK sees globalisation and its manifestations - such as immigration - as disempowering, impoverishing and a threat. Whereas for Londoners, globalisation is an economic competition they are apparently winning.\nOf course, there are tensions within London generated by the nature of its success - the west London ghettoes of the non-dom super-rich aren't everyone's cup of tea, and high and inflationary property prices undermine social cohesion.\nBut I haven't heard many Londoners describe the capital as \"the dark star of the economy\", which is how it was characterised in March by the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond.\nThe capital's gravitational pull for what Mr Salmond called \"resources, people and energy\" is bound to be seen with different degrees of enthusiasm by those inside and outside the Great Wen.\nAlex Salmond's hope was that an independent Scotland would be able to exert a new pull for talent and money, and provide more economic balance in this island.\nWhich some would say is a challenging argument to make, since the trends that are pumping up London are supra-national. In a world where barriers to the flow of money, services, people, goods and data have progressively been removed, vast flows of money, services, people, goods and data are drawn to where they find their ilk.\nOr to put it another way, the rise of London is the rise of one of the world's megacities, those urban centres which thrive semi-independently of the countries where they are located.\nAccording to the consultancy McKinsey, some 70% of all worldwide economic activity takes place in the world's 600 largest cities. And the most vital cities, on its analysis, are those that are most connected by becoming hubs or waypoints for skilled people, for goods, for services, for capital, and for data.\nOn this view, London is one of only six truly connected cities, along with New York, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. London scores relatively poorly only for goods traffic.\nWhat is striking about this half-dozen of the global elite metropolises is that three of them, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore, are city-states.\nSo it is not surprising that London is seen by some, including seemingly Mayor Johnson periodically, as extra the UK, almost a city-state.\nInevitably therefore one of the big political and economic questions of our age is whether national governments should encourage or attempt to stifle the rise and rise of these great cities - because they can be seen not only as economically over-mighty but politically too.\nThe British government sees London as a great asset to be nurtured - punching above its weight in respect of tax generation and helping to sell the UK to the rest of the world.\nSo it will probably see the latest forecast by the CEBR of London's growth as a reason to be cheerful. The CEBR sees London as accounting for almost a third of all UK growth in the next five years.\nThe CEBR expects the London economy to expand by 15.4% till 2019, faster than other UK regions, and compared with 10.7% for the UK as a whole.\nWhich means that London's share of the total British economy will continue to grow. According to official figures, the output or gross value added of London was 21% of UK output in 2007. It had risen to 22% in 2011, and if the CEBR is right, London will be nudging a quarter of the entire UK economy by 2019.\nLooked at in that way, it is pretty difficult to see how London could be put back in its box, even if the government wished to do this, without doing serious harm to the nation's finances and prosperity.\nIf London's growth were to slow considerably, then revenue generation for the government and employment creation for the country would also slow - probably harmfully.\nSo for those who want a more regionally balanced UK economy, the trick presumably is to spur faster growth outside London.\nBut that has been the ambition of so many governments, for so long. And has arguably become even harder in a world where capital seems increasingly drawn to capitals (very bad pun, sorry).\nOr to put it another way, the problem isn't London. The problem (if there is one) is that globalisation is all about how money, data and skilled people do what they want and go where they want.\nWhich implies the task of government is to harness and tame capital's love of metropolises in such a way that London and its peers are seen as engines of national wealth creation, and providers of national resources that otherwise would not be affordable.\nThat said, if globalisation means that the rise of London and other outward looking megacities is unstoppable, it is difficult to see how the economic gap between capital and provinces can do anything but continue to widen.\nAnd whether redistribution of wealth from urban centre to the rest of the country will allay the legitimate fears of many outside the megacities that the global economy is not run for them, well that is moot.","summary":"How much of the rise in Europe's anti-establishment parties of right and left is cyclical and how much is long-term and secular?","id":"27585765"}
{"document":"They believe a Canadian lynx was prowling around the fields of the South West in 1903 before being shot after attacking two dogs in Devon.\nTests on the animal revealed it had probably spent some time in captivity before escaping or being set free.\nThe animal had been donated to Bristol Museum at the time of its death and kept in its stores for decades.\nThe scientists' findings are published in the journal Historical Biology.\nDr Ross Barnett, a molecular biologist from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Durham, said:  \"I've seen one of these cats in the wild.\n\"They are pretty impressive cats - they are a reasonable size, and they have lots of fluffy fur which makes them look even bigger. They have sharp claws, teeth and strong muscles.\"\nFrom blurry photos of the Beast of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, to reports of a lion on the loose in Essex in 2012, the UK has a long tradition of spotting big cats.\nMost of these claims are dismissed as misidentifications, hoaxes or even hallucinations, but not in this case.\nIn 1903, the unusual cat was donated to the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's records state that it had been shot after attacking and killing two dogs close to Newton Abbot in Devon.\nUnsure of exactly what it was, the exotic beast was stuffed, its skeleton preserved, and then the remains were tucked away in the museum's stores.\nMore than a century later, the cat was unearthed by a scientist who thought the find might be significant.\nAn analysis of the skeleton and mounted skin revealed that the animal was a Canadian lynx, which is about two to three times the size of a domestic cat and is usually found in Canada and the northern states of the US.\nThe researchers found that the animal's teeth were badly decayed.\nDr Barnett said:  \"We think it had probably been in captivity at some point in its life.\n\"It had lost all of its incisors, which would have been a pretty debilitating injury for a wild cat, but not a problem for one in captivity.\n\"It also had massive amounts of plaque on its molars, which are indication of it not having a wild diet - something with lots of wet cat food, essentially ready-processed meat like steaks.\"\nThe researchers believe that the lynx had been in captivity for some time, but they were unable to find any records of the cat's owner.\n\"Was it someone's pet? Was it part of a small menagerie that was travelling through the area? There aren't really any zoos nearby where it could have escaped from,\" Dr Barnett said.\nThe team is also unsure how long the animal had been at large in Devon before it was killed.\nIts decayed teeth would have limited its chances in the wild, but the lynx is an adaptable animal, and may have been able to survive by preying on small mammals.\nWhile many big cat sightings remain unverified, sometimes the rumours do turn out to be true, and the team believes that the Canadian lynx is the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK.\nAnother case relates to a live puma that was captured in Inverness-shire in 1980 and had been living in the wild for a long period of time. It was called Felicity, and placed in a zoo.\nBut Dr Barnett said that these cases were few and far between.\nHe said: \"It's all very good saying you saw a lion in Essex or a tiger in Shropshire, or wherever. But it is very difficult to estimate size of a species from a distance - especially if you are unfamiliar with them.\n\"So I would argue for continued scepticism, unless you have a body or specimen you can analyse.\"","summary":"A \"big cat\" was on the loose in the English countryside at the turn of the last century, scientists say.","id":"22263874"}

{"document":"The bones most commonly broken in human punch-ups also gained the most strength in early \"hominin\" evolution.\nThey are also the bones that show most divergence between males and females.\nThe paper, in the journal Biological Reviews, argues that the reinforcements evolved amid fighting over females and resources, suggesting that violence drove key evolutionary changes.\nFossil records show that the australopiths, immediate predecessors of the human genus Homo, had strikingly robust facial structures.\nFor many years, this extra strength was seen as an adaptation to a tough diet including nuts, seeds and grasses. But more recent findings, examining the wear pattern and carbon isotopes in australopith teeth, have cast some doubt on this \"feeding hypothesis\".\n\"In fact, [the australopith] boisei, the 'nutcracker man', was probably eating fruit,\" said Prof David Carrier, the new theory's lead author and an evolutionary biologist at the University of Utah.\nInstead of diet, Prof Carrier and his co-author, physician Dr Michael Morgan, propose that violent competition demanded the development of these facial fortifications: what they call the \"protective buttressing hypothesis\".\nIn support of their proposal, Carrier and Morgan offer data from modern humans fighting. Several studies from hospital emergency wards, including one from the Bristol Royal Infirmary, show that faces are particularly vulnerable to violent injuries.\n\"Jaws are one of the most frequent bones to break - and it's not the end of the world now, because we have surgeons, we have modern medicine,\" Prof Carrier explained. \"But four million years ago, if you broke your jaw, it was probably a fatal injury. You wouldn't be able to chew food... You'd just starve to death.\"\nThe jaw, cheek, eye and nose structures that most commonly come to grief in modern fist fights were also the most protected by evolutionary changes seen in the australopiths.\nFurthermore, these are the bones that show the most differences between men and women, as well as between our male and female forebears. That is how you would expect defensive armour to evolve, Prof Carrier points out.\n\"In humans and in great apes in general... it's males that are most likely to get into fights, and it's also males that are most likely to get injured,\" he told BBC News.\nInterestingly, the evolutionary descendents of the australopiths - including humans - have displayed less and less facial buttressing.\nThis is consistent, according to Prof Carrier, with a decreasing need for protection: \"Our arms and upper body are not nearly as strong as they were in the australopiths,\" he explained. \"There's a temporal correlation.\"\nThe facial buttressing idea builds on a previous observation by Prof Carrier and Dr Morgan that the early hominins were the first primates to evolve a hand shape compatible with making a fist - and thus, throwing a punch.\nThat earlier paper attracted criticism from some other researchers, and Prof Carrier expects this new contribution may also prove controversial. He says that debate about the role of violence in human evolution is not new.\n\"[Our paper] does address this debate of whether our past was violent or peaceful,\" he told the BBC. \"That's an argument that's been going on for a very long time.\"\n\"The historical record goes back a short time, the archaeological record goes back a few tens of thousand years more... But the anatomy holds clues to what selection was important, what behaviours were important, and so it gives us information about the very distant past.\"","summary":"A new theory suggests that our male ancestors evolved beefy facial features as a defence against fist fights.","id":"27720617"}

We don't want to go through that again.\"\nAs the vast majority of Russians get their news from TV, the message is starting to penetrate.\nA poll this week by the independent Levada centre in Moscow revealed that 72% of Russians support the airstrikes.\nThat is a dramatic turn-around since the last survey before the military and media campaigns began, when a majority were opposed.\nIt is a reassuring result for Vladimir Putin, for whom the Syria campaign is another chance to play the strong man and reassert Russia on the global power map.\nThe first cruise missiles modern Russia has ever launched in combat were fired on his 63rd birthday; the dramatic images were screened repeatedly, almost like celebratory fireworks.\nThe next day's newspapers hailed the barrage as proof that Russia is back to rival the USA, after President Putin's massive investment in a military modernization drive.\nBut the Levada centre survey revealed another important statistic.\n\"There is a clear fear that Russia will get stuck in Syria, like the Soviet Union did in Afghanistan; that this will be a long campaign, with human sacrifice and great cost,\" the centre's director Lev Gudkov points out.\nThat is despite repeat assurances that Russia will not deploy ground troops.\n\"The Kremlin is underlining that this is a short-term operation, and only from the air. But what happens if militants attack the Russian airbase? It's completely unclear how things would develop then,\" Mr Gudkov adds.\nAnd there is another problem brewing.\nRussia is busily portraying its Syria campaign as a war on terror. But the fact that it is supporting a Shia-led alliance against Sunni opposition has not been lost on its own Muslim population.\nAt least 11% of Russian citizens are Muslim, most of them Sunni.\nAt a recent ceremony at the new Moscow central mosque many expressed support for the policy of Vladimir Putin.\nThey echoed a speaker inside who blamed the United States for sowing chaos in the Middle East.\n\"They want to divide the Muslim world,\" Adam Delimkhanov argued.\nBut privately, other mosque-goers voiced concern.\n\"That's just politics,\" one man commented of the speech. \"Of course we're worried.

But there is a danger the policy could radicalise people instead.\n\"There will definitely be consequences here in Russia, some response from IS,\" one young Chechen called Mansur said.\n\"They won't just leave it at that,\" he added, admitting that he was worried about a possible terror attack.\nSome commentators suggest President Putin hoped his actions in Syria would help thaw relations with the West, even soften the painful sanctions imposed over his last intervention, in Ukraine.\nBut the signs so far have not been promising. Instead the Syria campaign risks adding new pressure to Russia's already weakened economy.\nThe short-term impact will be minimal as the vast defence budget is pre-allocated. But Russia is now firing its latest cruise missiles and if the conflict drags on, the costs will mount.\n\"We have to pay for this military action. A big figure, and in this complex economic situation,\" politician Dmitry Gudkov points out.\nThe only independent deputy in Russia's parliament, he says MPs never discussed the intervention.\nBut he argues that behind the headline 72% public support, commitment to this campaign does not run deep.\n\"Maybe the government decided to shift attention from Ukraine to Syria,\" Mr Gudkov suggests.\n\"But it's too far from our country. Russian TV needs to work hard, to make people focus on this agenda. I know state media are broadcasting the situation non-stop, but I think Russians are not really interested,\" he explains.\nFor now, Vladimir Putin's decisiveness and posturing before the West are winning him plaudits.\nBut he has no obvious exit strategy from this conflict and the longer it goes on, the greater the risks to both Russia and its President.","summary":"With fighter jets flying up to 70 sorties a day in Syria, Russia's powerful media machine has gone into overdrive.","id":"34498862"}

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe story of how the clubs intertwine is well documented but takes its roots from 2002, when second-tier side Wimbledon were without a permanent home and deep in financial uncertainty.\nA consortium led by Pete Winkelman decided to take the club from south London to Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire - after having the controversial move approved by an independent commission.\nSince then a lot of water has passed under the bridge and neither side can agree on everything that actually happened.\nBut what is true is that the club set up by Wimbledon supporters 14 years ago in protest to the move now finds itself in the same division as Winkelman's MK Dons.\nMore than that, the phoenix club AFC Wimbledon are above MK Dons in the League One table ahead of their first-ever league meeting.\nThey have played against each other in the FA Cup, League Cup and Football League Trophy - but there is something different about a league match. So BBC Sport wanted to find out what fans of both clubs feel going into Saturday's match at Stadium:MK.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nA win could take AFC Wimbledon into the third-tier promotion places - but even a match of this importance cannot tempt some into travelling north for the game.\nSimon Wheeler, chairman of Wimbledon Independent Supporters' Association, has proclaimed he will never set foot in Stadium:MK, even organising boycotts for teams other than AFC Wimbledon playing in Milton Keynes between 2003 and 2006.\nWheeler, who has met Winkelman on a number of occasions, is one of several AFC fans wanting MK Dons to drop the final part of their name, but insists it is up to individual fans whether or not they choose to go to the match.\n\"Initially with the FA Cup game [the first meeting in 2012], MK were making a big thing about it and trying to build up a rivalry,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"Us Wimbledon supporters were saying it's not a rivalry; they have done a lot of damage, caused a lot of pain and done a lot wrong with the way they got their formation.\n\"Now we are in the same league as them, we are competitive in that league and, more importantly, above them.\n\"They are effectively having a club set up by the fans, because of the theft of Wimbledon's Football League place, sitting above them in the same league as them. It must be incredibly embarrassing.\"\nA prominent feeling among AFC Wimbledon fans is to question why Winkelman did not start with a club in non-league and, like them, work their way up.\nAFC began in the Combined Counties League in 2002, after trialling players on Wimbledon Common, and 14 years later find themselves in League One.\n\"They were presented with a place in the Championship, a brand new stadium and an eight-division head start over us, all on a plate,\" said AFC Wimbledon season-ticket holder Chris West, another who will not be going to the game.\n\"Catching them up so quickly just shows what can be done when a community club pulls together and how, despite his promises of creating a festival of football in Milton Keynes, Winkleman has squandered the opportunity he was presented with.\"\nEver since the move to Milton Keynes and the 30,000-seater Stadium:MK, Winkelman has emphasised a style of football some would say is the antithesis of Wimbledon FC's trademark physicality.\nThe club also prides itself on its youth policy, bringing through the Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli, Milton Keynes-born and all.\nStill the feeling towards the club runs deep in some quarters.\nHowever, when the club made the move to Buckinghamshire, some Wimbledon FC fans followed. Dom Damesick was one of those.\nThe Wimbledon season-ticket holder was 12 when the club made the journey up the M1, and felt \"the logical thing\" would be to follow them, encouraging his parents to come with him when they could get there from their home in Surrey.\n\"I don't really remember having a conversation about it like 'what's going to happen now?',\" he said.\n\"When the move happened I was 12. Then, especially as my parents weren't particular big football fans, my interest was in the team. You idolise the players you grow up watching and that team moved to Milton Keynes, so it felt like a natural continuation to follow them.\n\"Now I'm older and understand more about the importance of a football club to a local community, I think if the move happened now it would give me more pause for thought.\n\"But, having said that, Wimbledon was a failed football club and going out of business. Milton Keynes gave that football club a chance to have a second life. I don't think it's the same football club, in the same way I don't think AFC Wimbledon is the Wimbledon FC.\"\nDamesick became a MK Dons season-ticket holder in his late teens and insists there is no denying there is a rivalry between the two clubs, even if it is \"unconventional\".\nHe says he knows of around 100 fans who have made the same switch of allegiances as he did, and hopes people would not begrudge him supporting the club, in the same way he does not begrudge AFC fans.\n\"I don't think the people that go and watch MK are the reason that Wimbledon ceased to be,\" he added.\n\"I suppose you could say if people hadn't gone to watch MK Dons then the move would have failed, but that wouldn't have brought Wimbledon back. There's a needless spite.\n\"I think there are greater evils in modern football like people staying at home and watching on TV rather than going out and supporting local lower-league football, corruption in football, the amount of money at the top of the game and people getting priced out of seeing their team.\n\"These are much more damaging to football in this country than people having local football put on their doorstep and going out and watching that.\"\nNot all AFC Wimbledon fans have decided to forgo the trip to Buckinghamshire.\nSeason-ticket holder Steve Dowse grew up close to Plough Lane and will be one of an estimated 2,000 AFC fans in Stadium:MK to see his side face a team \"with a silly name\", as he puts it.\n\"I can't see MK as just another club - they stole our league place,\" said 47-year-old Dowse, who remembers Wimbledon FC's Southern League days in the 1970s.\n\"I didn't go to previous cup games on principle. My sons are keen to go this time and I'll be going with them.\n\"This will be the first league meeting between us and I'm looking forward to reminding them that, whatever the result, we're currently above them in the league.\n\"We've achieved this the right way, working our way up the pyramid. Perhaps if MK had done that, I might have some respect for them.\"\nThe move to Milton Keynes, a new town of around 200,000 in 2003, introduced a totally new set of fans to a local Football League team, including MK Dons season-ticket holder Liam O'Brien, who now writes a blog about the side.\nO'Brien has defended Winkelman in the face of accusation by AFC fans, after, in his eyes, saving a club playing away from its spiritual Plough Lane home and struggling financially.\n\"The fact is, Wimbledon were most likely going to collapse anyway,\" said O'Brien. \"There was no home for them. Fans were becoming increasingly frustrated about playing their games in Crystal Palace.\n\"So Pete Winkelman came along, suggested the move to Milton Keynes, and many agreed with him. Milton Keynes was viewed as the ideal place to move the club, with a vision to build a state-of-the-art stadium.\"\nAnd how is the boycott by some AFC Wimbledon fans seen by an MK Dons supporter?\n\"Fans should be supporting their club whoever they play regardless of their views on the other team,\" said Valmik Devchand from MK Dons Fan TV.\n\"Given the form that AFC Wimbledon are in, it is likely that they can get a good result against fierce rivals, so boycotting the game because of past events seems inappropriate.\"\nWith all the conjecture surrounding the match, it is almost easy to forget there is 90 minutes of football to be played.\n\"If you're looking at this one on paper and focus on current form then AFC will win,\" said BBC Three Counties Radio commentator Luke Ashmead.\n\"The visitors have been defeated just once in 13 league games, not lost away from home in the league since the opening day of the season, and are just outside the play-offs courtesy of goal difference.\n\"Conversely, MK Dons are 19th, have recorded just one win in nine, and still haven't seen three points from a home game in the league this season.\n\"Games like this, though, have a tendency to turn that paper we often like to play the game on into the type of material dropped in a pink Milton Keynes recycling sack.\"","summary":"Two teams that need no introduction to each other are AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons.","id":"38252537"}

The Dragons finished the season strongly under caretaker boss Carl Darlington but he opted against the role full-time and Wrexham appointed the experienced Gary Mills.\nMills wasted no time in making changes to the squad with experienced heads and Racecourse favourites such as captain Dean Keates and Neil Ashton among those released at the end of last season.\nThe former Gateshead manager, assisted by former Tottenham player Darren Caskey, has signed 10 players and a further two on loan during the close season. Despite the wholesale changes, the former Nottingham Forest man has been pleased by the new-look squad's progress during pre-season.\nLast season's top-scorer Louis Moult has left for Motherwell and the pressure will be on replacement James Gray to score the goals. The presence of centre half Manny Smith - so impressive in his first season at the club - is also a major boost.\nMany Wrexham supporters were unhappy with the manner of midfielder Lee Fowler's departure to big-spending Fleetwood Town in 2012. But the 32-year-old Welshman has returned to the Racecourse on a one-year contract and Mills has shown his faith in the former Coventry City and Wales Under-21 player by making him captain.\nFowler has a big void to fill following the departure of former skipper and midfield general Keates.\nTitle - 10\/1\nRelegation - 40\/1\nManager sacking - not available\nOdds supplied by BetVictor\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMills knows how to get teams promoted - he guided York City to a play-off final win in 2012 - and the former European Cup winner brings a no-nonsense approach to the job.\nIt will be interesting to see how the new-look squad takes shape during the opening weeks of the campaign but Wrexham should be among the front-runners.\nNational League: 4th FA Cup: Second round.\nGary Mills: \"I'm always going to feel the expectation but it doesn't affect how I work.

{"document":"Michael O'Neill, the man who led them to France, talks to BBC Sport about their expectations for the tournament, how they have prepared, and his hopes of creating a 1982 World Cup-style legacy.\nI'm glad Euro 2016 is almost here. There has been a sense that it is never going to come and you're waiting and waiting.\nIt's a huge thing to be there. When we won our first three qualifying games people really began to think we can do this. Then you feel there is a lot to lose because you feel it is possible.\nSo to deliver qualification for the people of Northern Ireland was a huge achievement by the players. I'm delighted for the players who have had long careers and at times there have been difficult moments in those careers. Their loyalty alone has been rewarded by reaching Euro 2016.\nMy message to the players is this is an experience we all have to enjoy. We don't want to come away with regrets. I don't want the players burdened by expectation but they have to grasp this opportunity.\nLeicester won this season's Premier League at odds of 5,000-1. Northern Ireland, the outsiders along with Albania, are 500-1 to win Euro 2016.\nIt's amazing how football changes. In our third qualifier we beat Greece and Claudio Ranieri was the coach. He lost his job the following game. For him to come to the Premier League, at his stage of his career, and win it is an amazing achievement - the stuff of fairytales.\nThere are similarities between Leicester and Northern Ireland when you look at the route a lot of the Leicester players took to get to where they are. We have lads who are at Fleetwood Town [Vardy's previous club].\nIn terms of how we play there are similarities, too. Hopefully the neutrals will see a nice humility and work ethic about our team.\nWhile we're realistic enough to think we're not going to win the tournament, hopefully we get that level of support where we get a huge groundswell of people willing us to do well, which takes us as far as we can go.\nO'Neill managed Scottish third tier side Brechin City from April 2006 until December 2008, when he became Shamrock Rovers boss. He led the Dublin club to two Irish titles and to the group stages of the Europa League.\nHe left Rovers for the Northern Ireland job in December 2011 and recently signed a new four-year deal.\nI started my managerial career at the bottom. I had to go to a small club in Scotland who were part-time and I was working in financial services.\nI had an opportunity to go over to Shamrock Rovers. People thought that was a bit of a strange move but I felt it was a good opportunity.\nI didn't plan to be the national manager when it came around. I was 42 but I said to myself 'why not see where it takes me?'.\nIt's been a huge challenge. There were difficult times in the first two years but it taught me about perseverance. I probably underestimated the size of the job to progress things. But we have got where we are and it has been immensely rewarding for me.\nIt will be hard to top taking my country to a major finals whatever happens in my future career.\nNorthern Ireland open against Poland on 12 June, before playing Ukraine four days later and facing Germany on 21 June. With four third-placed teams going through to the last 16, one win might be enough.\nThe order of the fixtures is favourable to us. I'm glad we are playing Germany last because we could have been playing them earlier, had a really tough result and had to lift the players. At least we don't have to face that until the last group game.\nEven if we draw the first game, we go into the second game almost like a cup final and know if we win this game we will probably qualify.\nPoland is a tough game but when I look at qualification both Scotland and the Republic of Ireland drew with them. Robert Lewandowski is obviously a player that we are going to have to deal with but it is not beyond us to get a draw or a win.\nUkraine's strength is in their wide players - Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka. They narrowly got past Slovenia [in Euro 2016 play-off], who we beat in March. I spoke to Chris Coleman about Ukraine because his Wales team were beaten 1-0 by them in March. He said they were tough and physical. We'll have to match that.\nGermany had a bit of a hangover from the 2014 World Cup in qualification - losing to the Republic of Ireland and Poland. It will be a tough ask but when you go into a game like that you have everything to gain. Our aim is to have something to play for by the time we face them.\nBetween myself and one of my coaches who does the analysis, Austin MacPhee, we've watched the 10 qualification games of each of the countries in our group.\nI've seen Germany live and we've had Poland and Ukraine watched live whenever the opportunity existed in the recent friendly matches. One of our biggest strengths is the knowledge we have of the opposition.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI went to Poland and Ukraine for Euro 2012 and I felt the atmosphere in the stadiums was fantastic.\nI remember thinking it would be magical to come to something like this with Northern Ireland and now we're getting a chance to do it. It's going to be special.\nIt's been a huge few months. When you look at the scenes after the Greece game, it was euphoria. There's a generation of people in Northern Ireland who have never had the chance to see their country compete in a major tournament.\nThe excitement is tangible anywhere you go in Northern Ireland. It's hard not to feel it. Jumping in a taxi, the driver wants to talk about it. It's nice that we've created that.\nA lot of people talk about the spirit and the work-rate of the squad. But there's quality within that. Some players when they pull on a green shirt are able to lift themselves above the level they play club football.\nIt's not just spirit and togetherness that gets you to Euro 2016. We won our qualifying group by being the top scorers. We are a big threat at set-pieces, which is a big part of the game. The template that got us to France will hopefully stand us in good stead.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe last time Northern Ireland qualified for a major tournament was the 1986 World Cup, but it was their campaign in 1982 which lives in fans' memories - beating hosts Spain on the way to the knockout stages.\nI remember it vividly. I was 12, at home in Ballymena, watching on television. It was different then because there was not the amount of coverage on television as now.\nSo when the World Cup and European Championships came round it was huge. I remember Gerry Armstrong scoring, Mal Donaghy getting sent off and Pat Jennings playing amazingly well.\nNorthern Ireland were playing host nation Spain with 10 men and still won. It was just magical. That team achieved great things and that is the inspiration we will take for this tournament. We want to go to France and create our very own legacy.\nUnfortunately [manager for both those World Cups] Billy Bingham's health is not good at the minute - he has dementia. But I received congratulations and well wishes through his son when we qualified.\n[Golfer] Rory McIlroy has been in touch, so too boxer Carl Frampton, singer Gary Lightbody and actor Jimmy Nesbitt.\nAll the previous players have been very generous with their praise.

{"document":"But the town, in northern China's Hebei province, is actually devoted to waste recycling. Mountains of glass bottles and scraps of plastic crowd every available space.\nSitting in the middle of it all is a boarding school. Not one for the wealthy but, like many boarding schools in China, a school for the sons and daughters of local farmers and migrant workers. Poor families send their children here, hoping they'll get an education that will elevate them above the grime and dirt pervading this place.\nThe Zhang family sent their teenage son there after a visit from recruiters.\n\"We were told the school was one of the best out here. It was supposed to have military-style discipline and good teachers,\" Mr Zhang explains.\nThose were empty promises, they now say.\nLast December, a teacher at the school - a man named Li Jian - was sent to prison. For years, he had abused the Zhangs' son and several other teenage boys.  We've changed the family's name to protect the boy's identity.\nLi Jian admitted to forcing the students back to his home. There, they were bound and gagged, tortured and raped, a court heard. Li Jian threatened his victims with death if they told anyone what took place in his apartment.\nAs the abuse stretched on, the boy became extremely depressed.\n\"He used to cry and refuse to return to school,\" his mother remembers. \"At first, we didn't understand why. My husband became very angry. But now we know. Our son was suffering.\"\nEventually, the boy became the first to speak up. \"The situation was getting worse so I told my parents,\" he whispers. \"But the memories still haunt me.\"\nLi Jian, the teacher, was in charge of discipline at the school. In court, the boys testified that Li would pick on the students who made mistakes during the school's morning exercise drills. Those are the ones he would bring back to his home for \"extra instruction\".\nLi received a prison sentence of two years and 10 months. China has no laws banning male rape over the age of 14. The victims could not prove the sexual abuse started before they were 14, so the court only found Li Jian guilty of detaining his students.\nFrustrated with China's piecemeal child abuse laws, the victim's families are appealing for a harsher punishment. They're pushing Li Jian to pay compensation so the boys can receive costly psychological counselling.\nThey feel other parts of the system, too, failed their sons.\nWhen the Zhangs first went to the police station to report the crime, police there appeared to be familiar with Li Jian, who had worked at other boarding schools in the province before coming to Erliban village.\n\"When we said the teacher's name, the officer said \"Li Jian? That creep is doing it again!\" So they knew about this before but didn't do anything to stop him,\" Mr Zhang fumes.\nThe police ignored our repeated interview requests.\nSchool officials refused to answer similar allegations from the victims' families and several teachers that the school had also turned a blind eye to the abuse.\nIt seems that no-one really knows what takes place behind closed doors in China's boarding schools. Thirty million children across mainland China attend schools far away from home, according to Ministry of Education statistics from last year.\nAdvocates from Save the Children warn there's a \"high risk\" of abuse at Chinese boarding schools without proper safeguards in place. Children as young as five live far away from their parents, at schools with no teacher background checks and no means to report sexual or physical violence.\nPia MacRae, China country director, Save the Children\n\"Aside from being awful thing to experience, research highlights the correlation between sexual abuse and many other problems - including mental health, learnings outcomes and the ability to build long term healthy relationships.\nWe simply do not have the data to know whether the prevalence has increased in China recent years.  What we do know is that children away from their parents (either because they are at boarding school or left behind with relatives) are on aggregate more vulnerable.\nIt is also clear that social media has played a critical role in bringing attention to more extreme cases which has also raised awareness of the issue of sexual abuse more generally. We see an increase in commitment to address this issue from our partners in government and in schools.\"\nThe Ministry of Education is working on a national student protection plan.\nBut future changes are of little consolation to the Zhang family. They're packing what little they own.\n\"My son can't live here. We have to leave,\" Mr Zhang explains, choking back tears.\n\"We came here 20 years ago. We even had a little business, but now we've closed it. Even our house is falling apart,\" he says, gesturing to cracks in the walls of the family farmhouse.\nSo, they're moving away to start a new life. Tired of a system that didn't keep their child safe and can't deliver justice now.","summary":"At first glance, Erliban village appears to be covered in rubbish.","id":"32126839"}

{"document":"With England needing eight to win in Nagpur, Bumrah removed Joe Root and Jos Buttler, the former wrongly given lbw, and conceded only two runs.\nBen Stokes (38) looked to be taking England to their target of 145 before falling lbw to Ashish Nehra (3-28).\nOpener KL Rahul earlier made 71 from 47 balls in India's 144-8.\nThat was three runs fewer than India managed in England's comfortable seven-wicket win in the first T20 game in Kanpur, but this chase was more challenging on a slower, lower surface.\nAnd though the majority of England's attack impressed, their spinners were outbowled by India's, with pace bowlers Nehra and Bumrah making telling contributions at each end of the visitors' innings.\nThe deciding third match takes place in Bangalore on Wednesday.\nEngland needed 24 from the last two overs, but were made favourites by the hitting of Buttler, who took 12 from Nehra's final three balls, complete with a bottom-handed fetch over the long-on fence.\nIt was left to jerky right-armer Bumrah to defend eight runs off the concluding six balls, which began with a slice of fortune that saw Root adjudged leg before, despite an inside edge, departing for a run-a-ball 38.\nFrom there, Bumrah befuddled England with a full length and changes of pace - the tourists only laid bat on one of the last five deliveries, and even that was a Moeen Ali miscue for a single.\nWhen a swiping Buttler was bowled, England's best hope went with him, and Moeen failed to make contact when a six was needed off the final ball.\nEngland's chase was dealt an early blow by 37-year-old left-armer Nehra, who learned from the way the tourists bowled back-of-a-length to have openers Sam Billings and Jason Roy caught on the leg side from successive deliveries.\nFrom 22-2, Root rebuilt in the company of captain Eoin Morgan, England happy to accumulate in the face of the accuracy of the India spinners as only three boundaries came in one 10-over period.\nIt took the power hitting of Stokes to ignite the chase, the left-hander making the most of a reprieve after being bowled by no-ball by spinner Amit Mishra, from the first delivery he faced.\nMuscling the ball to long-on for two fours and two sixes, Stokes looked to be in control of the pursuit before being pinned in front by the returning Nehra.\nWhen he departed, England required 28 from 19 deliveries. As Bumrah and Nehra excelled, they managed only 19, and 10 of those came from two Buttler blows.\nWhereas India's spinners used the conditions to squeeze England in the middle overs, the home batsmen pounced on slow bowlers Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson.\nRashid, who did not bowl in Kanpur, and Dawson, in the side for paceman Liam Plunkett, conceded a combined 44 runs from their five overs.\nRahul, who averages 64.50 in his seven T20 internationals, took each of them for a leg-side maximum to go with the sweet cover drives he played off the fast bowlers.\nAlong with the rest of the middle order, Rahul was tied down by Moeen, the off-spinner returning excellent figures of 1-20 to give him a collective 3-41 from eight overs in the series, with only one boundary conceded.\nRahul eventually lofted Chris Jordan to deep mid-wicket, the second of three wickets for the Sussex paceman who also could have had Virat Kohli lbw for seven.\nThe reprieved Kohli went on to punish Tymal Mills, who recovered as part of a controlled display by England's pace attack, particularly at the death. But by then, the damage had been done.\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"We were in the driving seat, right up until the last over. We didn't start the over well - a decision didn't go our way and losing an 'in' batsman like Joe Root hurt us. We bowled really well again.\n\"We have struggled to string performances together with the ball, but we have been right on the money in the last two games. The chase never got too far away from us. Joe Root played really well, as did Ben Stokes. It's unbelievably disappointing to lose this game but we have to take it on the chin.\"\nIndia captain Virat Kohli: \"Bumrah was asking me after every ball what he should do and I said 'just play your game and if it goes for a six we still wake up tomorrow and everything is OK'.\"\nMan of the match Jasprit Bumrah: \"I tried to assess the wicket, to see what has happened in the first innings and what has worked for other bowlers. On this, it was a big ground and a slow wicket so back-of-a-length and slower balls were best.\n\"The confidence from the captain helps. He has given me the freedom to execute the plans.

{"document":"We drive up the hills in his pickup truck to see farmers harvest the coffee beans in the vast valley around us.\nCoffee has been the economic backbone of this region - on the border between the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo - for more than a century.\nBut after years of a commodity-fuelled boom, economies like Brazil are having a hard time adjusting to slower global demand and lower prices.\nOver the decades, the Lacerda family has known fortune and poverty, with their wealth always oscillating around coffee. Droughts, government policies, global consumption, currency problems - these were blessings and curses that determined the fate of the Lacerdas.\nBut in the past five years, farmers in this region are finding new ways to make their own fortunes, trying to move away from producing cheap commodity beans and instead invest in top quality production.\nTarcisio drives me to the top of the hill and lets me in on their secret.\nThe valley is filled with coffee trees - but not all of it produces particularly good coffee. In the past, farmers would collect all beans, put them in bags and ship them abroad, getting whatever prices were listed in the commodity markets.\nNow Tarcisio and his family are separating the best beans - most of which are from trees 1,500 metres above sea level - and producing their own specialty brands. The rest is sold to the market as cheaper, unprocessed green beans.\n\"Usually you double your price - going from commodity to specialty,\" he says.\n\"A bag of commodity coffee is now worth 450 reais ($110; ÃÂ£72) - but we can sell specialty at around 900 or 1000 reais ($220 or $240),\" he says.\nTarcisio takes me to his neighbour's farm - Forquilha do Rio - which has been winning some of Brazil's top awards for coffee.\nTheir quality has to do with the favourable local conditions - mild temperatures, good sun exposure and high altitude.\n\"We knew our coffee was good, but we had no idea it was this good,\" says Afonso de Abreu Lacerda (no relation to Tarcisio), in front of a cabinet packed with trophies.\n\"It wasn't until we started competing in awards, about five years ago, that we learned just how valuable it was,\" he adds.\nIn 2012, when Forquilha do Rio won one of Brazil's top awards, they were able to sell one of their lots for $950 - more than six times the commodity price at the time. They are now exporting their finished brand to China and Japan.\nThe \"specialty revolution\" is partly the brainchild of Tarcisio's son, 26-year-old Jhone.\nWhen he was just 15, Jhone dropped out of school and moved into the family property, determined to learn everything about the coffee trade.\nWith each harvest, father and son experimented with different ways of harvesting, drying up and roasting their product.\nJhone designed, built and patented a new coffee drying equipment - which is one of the crucial elements of turning commodity beans into gourmet food.\nHe also became a licensed Q-Grader - a special category of coffee tasters.\nThey started developing their own brand - Fazenda Santa Rita - after buying roasters, and now have their own packages.\n\"This change in direction is something that the markets imposed on us,\" says Jhone Lacerda.\n\"We used to depend on the price of commodities - on things like how much coffee other countries are drinking, or whether they are in crisis or not,\" he tells me.\n\"We want to be in a smaller market, but that does not depend just on demand. In the specialty market, it is not the global demand that drives prices. It is the quality of the product that you put out.\"\nJhone uses his Q-Grader skills to advise all producers in the region on what price to charge for their harvests.\nTogether with two other families, he created the Montanhas do Caparao, a blend of some of the region's best coffees that has also won a top prize in Brazil.\nJhone is now back in school, studying coffee production at Instituto Federal do EspÃÂ­rito Santo college.\nJhone's father tells me it took centuries for Brazil to finally wake up and smell its own specialty coffee. His parents had never thought of it before.\nBrazil is the world's top producer and exporter of coffee by a large margin. It makes about a third of the world's coffee - but virtually all of it is green beans of very low aggregate value.\nIn the commodity market, the price for green coffee beans depends on factors such as climate and global consumption.\nBut other types of commodities - like soybeans and iron ore - are now suffering from the slowdown of the Chinese economy.\nAs Brazil and Latin America rely heavily on commodities and Chinese consumption, the whole region is slowing down to the tune of those markets. Brazil's economy is expected to contract more than 2% this year.\nThe head of the foreign relations department in Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Alberto Coelho Fonseca, says producers in many different areas are now trying to add value to food by exporting refined products, which is a way to compensate for lower international prices.\n\"A specialty coffee can be sold at 300% more value than a non-specialty coffee,\" he says.\n\"Even if they have a very small share in exports, the techniques of producing good specialty coffee can spread value through the chain.\"\nNow some government officials want to help these premium brands take off abroad.\nIn next year's Rio Olympics, Brazil will serve its specialty coffee in tourism lounges in all venues.\nMr Fronseca adds: \"About 70% of the coffee brewed by coffeehouses like Starbuck, Cafe Nero or Costa is likely to be from Brazil. We need to showcases our products better.\"\nBack in the Caparao Mountains, local producers found another way to add value to their product - tourism.\nLocal farms opened up special cafes and hostels, where visitors are taken on coffee-tasting tours, modelled on California's wine-producing Napa valley.\nThis is still in its infancy, but it helps consolidate the region's reputation for quality blends.\nNow, say Jhone and Tarcisio Lacerda, half of the beans in their farms are already being used to produce their specialty roast, and they have big plans.\nJhone says: \"We want to produce the best coffee in the world.\n\"We want the Caparao region to become well-known across the world.\"","summary":"As soon as the sun rises in the Caparao Mountains in southeast Brazil, Tarcisio Lacerda takes me on a tour of his property.","id":"34393594"}

{"document":"Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.\nIn the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.\nThe mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland.\nProfile: Peter Higgs\n\"This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference,\" said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nProf Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.\n\"He's gone on holiday without a phone,\" his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell.\n\"He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm.\"\nBut the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:\n\"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy,\" he said.\n\"I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support.\n\"I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research.\"\nFrancois Englert, 80, said he was \"very happy\" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link.\n\"At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement,\" he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.\nHiggs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.\nHis theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.\nWithin weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.\nThree other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.\nHagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the \"rock star\" status in which Higgs is held.\nAnd Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle \"the scalar boson\".\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was \"glad\" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert.\n\"My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published.\n\"It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people.\n\"My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs.\"\nAnd the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: \"In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory.\"\nProving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.\nThe LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round.

Their own future without intervention. Don't make preconditions who will rule Syria,\" he said.\nMr Assad has consistently refused to step down since the beginning of the war, which has left more than 250,000 people dead, and correspondents say the recent battlefield successes of his forces have only hardened that view.\nThe HNC's \"Vision for Syria\" was unveiled in London by its general co-ordinator, Riyad Hijab, who defected in 2012 while serving as prime minister.\nHe said the plan envisaged three phases:\nIf the document on a transition in Syria had been produced by the political leaders of a victorious army at the gates of Damascus, it could be seen as an enlightened blueprint for the future.\nBut the regime in Damascus will dismiss it, because President Bashar al-Assad seems more secure in the capital than at any other time since the war started.\nIn 2013, when the chemical attack on the city's rebel-held eastern suburbs seemed certain to provoke American air strikes the regime looked shaky and afraid. But the strikes never came, and since then the president and his men have strengthened their positions. Crucially, Russia has intervened directly on the battlefield. President Assad cannot win as things stand, but he cannot lose either.\nThe war gets more complicated every year. Regional superpowers, and the world's most powerful countries have intervened. Dozens of different, and sometimes overlapping rebel groups operate on the battlefields. All have their own agendas. It's a mini world war. No wonder diplomacy fails.\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister said the plan would test Mr Assad's allies.\nBut Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC he was not optimistic that Russia and Iran were prepared to put the \"necessary pressure\" on the president \"in order to comply with the will of the international community\".\nMr Jubeir will discuss the HNC's blueprint with other foreign ministers from the Friend of Syria group of countries that support the opposition.\nUK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is hosting the meeting, wrote in The Times that there \"was still a chance that this vision can be made to work\".\n\"If the Russians and Americans can together create a ceasefire, then the talks can restart in Geneva with the difference, perhaps, that all sides will by then have seen at least the scaffolding of a post-Assad Syria,\" he added.\nMoscow and Washington, which backs the opposition and insists Mr Assad must go, have so far failed to reach an agreement on a new cessation of hostilities.\nAfter a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in China on Monday, Barack Obama said they had been unable to close \"gaps of trust\".\nUS officials are particularly concerned by the deteriorating conditions in and around Syria's second city, Aleppo, where rebel-held eastern areas are once again under siege after government forces advanced over the weekend.\nOn Monday, more than a 100 people were admitted to hospital following a suspected chlorine gas attack on the rebel-held Sukkari district.

{"document":"The latest figures available suggest more than 1.5 million homeowners may not have cover if the worst was to happen to their home.\nUntil last year Violet, a pensioner, lived in a semi-detached, thatched cottage which she inherited from her parents. Then in March, a fire believed to have started in her neighbour's chimney spread to her house, burning both of them down.\nSpeaking to Radio 4'sMoney Boxshe said: \"It quickly spread to my side. The wind was blowing my way, we had about 10 fire engines here but I lost just about everything.\"\nViolet's neighbour has buildings insurance and his insurer has agreed to meet his claim. Violet had cover until a few years ago but then cancelled it because of the cost, something she now bitterly regrets: \"Being on a low income, I had to let the contents and house insurance go, but in retrospect I wish I had been insured because now I can't claim on anything.\"\nSince the fire Violet has lived in a mobile home in her garden which local people clubbed together to buy her.\nVulnerable properties\nIt is unclear exactly how many other homeowners like Violet would not be covered if something similar happened to them.\nBut figures published by the Financial Services Authority in 2006 estimated that more than 10% of people do not have buildings insurance and UK government figures for 2010 put the number of owner occupiers at more than 17 million. This suggests the number of uninsured could be more than 1.5 million.\nThere is no evidence that the cause of the fire was as a result of negligence nor anything other than an accident.\nMalcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, says the only way someone in Violet's position might be able to claim is if they were able to prove their neighbour had been negligent: \"The law says if you want to claim against someone else you have to show they were negligent, and their negligence resulted in your property being damaged.\"\nHowever, that may not be an easy thing to prove. Laura Checkley, a property litigation solicitor at Pemberton Greenish, says an accident which was not easy to predict would not fall into this category: \"A person has to take reasonable care to make sure they don't cause reasonably foreseeable harm to another person's property.

Gordon completed a career Grand Slam in men's doubles when he won the 2017 Australian Open title with Belgium's Joachim Gerard.\nHe said: \"It was a last-minute partnership which was formed with Joachim but that's the last slam I needed to complete the set so now I have to try and do that in singles as well.\"\nAnd after that achievement, Gordon stayed to cheer on fellow Brit Andy from the players' box, as the quads singles final became the first wheelchair tennis match to be played on a centre court at a Grand Slam.\n\"I never thought I'd be in the players' box for Andy Lapthorne in Rod Laver Arena,\" said Gordon, smiling.\n\"Hopefully the other tournaments will follow suit and put some more wheelchair tennis matches on the big courts.\"\nAndy, who had already claimed the Australian Open doubles title for the fifth time at the tournament, eventually finished as runner-up to Australia's Dylan Alcott in the singles but it is a moment he will never forget.\n\"To be given the opportunity to showcase what we can do on a stage like that was amazing.\n\"I think maybe the occasion got to me though - not so much because I wanted to win but just because I love tennis and I knew what it meant to our sport to finally get the opportunity to play on that court.\n\"It's getting to the stage now where it's quite scary some of the courts we are playing on, but it's great and it's moving our sport forward and that's what we need to do.\"\nThey are ranked among the best in the world and they compete alongside the able-bodied game in the same tournaments, sharing the same locker rooms as the likes of Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\nAndy has even had a chance to hit with Djokovic, who, alongside Andy Murray, is a big supporter of the game.\nHe said: \"The first time he did it was at the US Open before he played Roger Federer in the final.\n\"The day before just randomly we said we were going to go and have a hit and he actually got in my everyday chair, which doesn't have an anti-tip on the back of it.\n\"And I thought he was going to tip out the day before the final.\"\nWhen the current generation of players retire - whenever that may be - they will leave behind a legacy that will inspire not just the next generation but many more.\nBut Andy, who has just added yet another doubles title to his growing list - meaning he is undefeated in doubles since November 2016 - has one last thing he wants to see happen before he can \"retire a happy boy\".\nHe plays in the quad division meaning that, unlike Gordon and Jordanne, he doesn't get the opportunity to play at Wimbledon and the French Open.\nA determined and passionate Andy said: \"Me and Dylan, we want that break at Wimbledon because that's where we want the rematch of this year's Australian Open final.\n\"I want to be part of the group or the main guy that gets us in those two Grand Slams so that when there's a young Andy Lapthorne or Dylan Alcott, some young kid who has got more than just his legs affected who has a dream of playing at Wimbledon, he doesn't wake up like I did and not have the opportunity.\"","summary":"It was Great Britain's most over-performing sport at both the Rio Olympics and Paralympics.","id":"39352850"}

Others were rejected because they were not British citizens.\nThe archives contain often brutal accounts of suffering and persecution, as well as the responses of Foreign Office bureaucrats charged with administering the fund.\nThe money was aimed principally at concentration camp survivors who had not won compensation under a separate German scheme set up in 1953.\nAmong those whose claims were rejected was Jimmy James, who took part in the Great Escape from Stalag Luft 3 in 1944 - made famous in the film of the same name. Fifty of the escapers were shot.\nJimmy James, along with others, was sent to a punishment camp known as Sonderlager A at Sachsenhausen concentration camp, north of Berlin.\nBy 1964, his file shows he was working for the Foreign Office as a visa officer at the British Embassy in Prague.\nThe file includes his handwritten account of his years in Nazi captivity, including his imprisonment with 18 others - six of them British - at Sachsenhausen - and a period spent in solitary inside the main camp when he once again tunnelled his way out, only to be recaptured.\nHe acknowledged the conditions he was kept under were not as harsh as those in Sachsenhausen proper, and that he could claim no permanent disability, before adding laconically, \"although, naturally, this is an experience which I should have preferred to have avoided\".\nHis claim was rejected on the grounds that as a prisoner of war he was not a victim of \"Nazi persecution\".\nBut there was a sequel.\nSome of his fellow \"Great Escapees\" went to the newspapers to complain and the foreign secretary set up an inquiry which resolved on pay-outs to the Sachsenhausen victims after all.\nAll were officers and two bore the name Churchill.

Szabo's experience was also later reflected in a film - called Carve Her Name with Pride.\nA friend of Tania Rosandic's mother's wrote from Ireland to press the girl's claim, which was accepted, but not before her solicitors had to find not only her mother's French birth certificate but also her grandfather's, to prove she was British.

{"document":"Cookson, the ex-head of British Cycling, beat Ireland's Pat McQuaid in a bitter election in late 2013.\nBut Armstrong is unimpressed with what he has seen of the president so far.\n\"If McQuaid had made the same decisions Cookson has made in his first year, he would have been lynched,\" said the disgraced cyclist.\n\"Do we like what we have got so far?\"\nArmstrong cited the decisions to \"rush\" through Team Sky's request for Chris Froome to get emergency steroid treatment for asthma after the Tour de Romandie's prologue and Cookson's handling of the Astana affair as failures to signal a new direction at the top of the sport.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAstana, the team for which Armstrong rode during his second comeback in 2009, have been mired in controversy ever since five riders in their system failed drugs tests in a matter of months last year.\nMany observers expected the UCI to revoke the team's WorldTour licence but after weeks of speculation the Kazakhstan-based outfit were given another chance in December.\nRun by Alexander Vinokourov, a contemporary of Armstrong's, Astana remain on probation and their anti-doping practices are being independently vetted, but the episode was widely seen as a challenge that Cookson ducked.\nAnd with Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali riding for Astana, the sport had once again left itself vulnerable to ridicule.\nSpeaking to the BBC in his first TV interview for two years, Armstrong said \"everybody thinks\" Astana should have been thrown out, but he accepted that Cookson's hands might have been tied by the UCI's rules.\nHe was less understanding, though, on the 63-year-old's failure to force the likes of Vinokourov, Tinkoff-Saxo's Bjarne Riis and other controversial team managers still in the sport, to cooperate with the panel set up by the UCI to investigate the sport's murky past.\nArmstrong has talked to the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (Circ) twice and is now waiting to see if his efforts will be rewarded with a recommendation that his lifetime ban from sport should be reduced.\nThat ban was given out by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) in 2012 when Armstrong failed to cooperate with its investigation into the teams with whom he won his seven Tour de France titles. He was also stripped of those victories.\nAny decision on reducing the ban rests with Usada, which might mean Armstrong is left disappointed, but he is angry that his peers have not been compelled to talk to Circ.\n\"If I'm Brian Cookson, I would make it a deal point that you have to come in and talk,\" he said.\n\"So if Riis doesn't talk to you, or Vinokourov doesn't, there should be consequences. I don't know those to be examples, but I can imagine.\n\"If you don't come in to talk, you don't just get passed.\"\nWhen asked for a reaction, Riis's team Tinkoff-Saxo said he has never refused to meet Circ and it wanted to respect the confidentiality of the process, while the UCI said it would wait until Circ's report is finished before commenting.\nThe three-man panel is expected to complete its year-long investigation in the coming weeks, with the UCI publishing it by the end of February.\nWhile Armstrong is underwhelmed by Britain's takeover at the UCI, he is far more conciliatory to the British riders who have followed him as Tour champions, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, particularly in relation to the doping questions they have had to face in his wake.\n\"I'm sorry, and I completely agree that because of the timing of things, it is down to me,\" he said.\n\"[Usada's reasoned decision] comes out after the Tour in 2012, so it's logical that in 2013 there's going to be a lot of questions. Especially in a year when Chris Froome performs exceptionally.\n\"Look, Froome won the Tour in 2013, that's 14 years after 1999. If in 1999 I was asked questions about the 1985 winner of the Tour de France, I'd be like 'What are you talking about? Why are you asking me about the mid-80s?'\n\"But the story was so relevant to people. When this went down, people were left with the impression, in 2012, that I was hanging blood bags six months earlier. That's not the case.\n\"So I feel bad for those guys, they shouldn't have been put in that position.

{"document":"With the sound of the drums echoing off the walls of the surrounding buildings, it feels as if it could be an impromptu street performance - but it's not.\nThis is tax collecting Bangalore-style.\nFed up with companies refusing to pay their tax bills, the city has gone one better than merely sending out reminder letters.\nInstead it is striking back, shaming local tax avoiders, through the use of music.\nBangalore has a clear message to offenders: Pay up or we send in the drummers, and then everybody will know what you've done wrong.\nAnd so far, it seems to be working.\n\"People like this. They gather to hear the drums playing,\" says one of the band, 19-year-old drummer Shankarantha.\nThe band's co-ordinator is K C Chellaiah, who is standing to one side, watching his team in action. He says while the audience might like it - those targeted do not.\n\"The company owners get afraid of it when the troupe starts beating the drum,\" he says.\n\"Usually the firms have a good name in their area and when this comes to people's attention and the real picture comes out of it, they start paying their tax immediately - they respond immediately.\"\nBy Yogita LimayeBusiness reporter, BBC News, Bangalore\nWhen we went with the drummers to one company located in south-east Bangalore, dozens of people came out of their homes and offices to see what was going on.\nThe lorry that carried the drummers had big banners on the front and sides displaying the name of the company that had evaded tax.\nHowever, no-one from the company was present at the office, and civic officials told us this was probably because information about the drum beating had leaked to them somehow.\nBut the authorities did not call off the drumming.\nIn fact they said the main purpose of the drive was to attract the attention of the company's neighbours and to try to shame the firm into paying up.\nBangalore's civic body isn't the only one to adopt this method to try to recover taxes.\nThe Delhi city corporation has launched a similar drive, and some years ago in Patna, the capital city of the central India state of Bihar, eunuchs were deployed to sing outside shops that had not paid taxes.\n10 things you might not know about India\nBangalore is India's third-largest city, and as the centre of the India's hi-tech industry, its economy is worth some $9.6bn (Â£6.1bn) a year.\nBut it has a problem with unpaid taxes, and so six months ago it started employing its teams of drummers.\nAnd it is proving to be steady work for the musicians.\nBand member Shankarantha says that he and his fellow players have been called out to beat the drum for Bangalore's tax department four times in the past few days.\n\"Initially we didn't get a good response,\" says Shivakumar CM, an executive engineer with Bangalore Municipal Corporation.\n\"Since then we have seen that about 50% of the firms we have targeted have come to us to pay up their taxes.\n\"We're getting a good response from companies which have been embarrassed,\" he says.\n\"This is the primary motor of the drum-beat programme.\"\nBut Bangalore is not alone in this. India has one of the lowest rates of tax payment in the world. Only 3% of India's population of 1.2 billion pay any tax at all.\nThere are several reasons for this:\nThis year, India's government has decided on a two-pronged approach to its tax problem.\nFirst, all those officially listed as earning over $185,000 a year - 42,000 individuals - will have to pay an extra 10% surcharge for one year.\nThe tax rate for higher earners will temporarily rise from 30 to 33%.\nYet when you realise that India is reckoned to have 125,000 millionaires, but only a third of them are officially listed as higher-rate tax payers, Delhi's problem becomes clear.\nSecond, the finance ministry has been sending out what it says are \"polite\" reminder letters to 1.2 million people who appear to possess enough wealth to require paying taxes.\nInstead of focusing on declared income, India's tax collectors are looking at people's spending patterns - what significant payments are made on credit cards, and whether properties or shares have been bought or sold.\nEstimates of how much tax Delhi is losing vary, but the government itself says people avoided paying some $70m of taxes and duties in the first three months of 2013 alone.\nSource: World Bank\nWorld Bank statistics\nBut improving the tax-collection rate nationally will be a challenge.\n\"Trying to enhance tax collection from the sectors which are not paying taxes is important,\" says Nikhil Bhatia, executive director at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nBut before many more Indians would be willing to pay up, he says the government must prove that it is spending the tax revenues it does get efficiently.\n\"Curbing expenditure which is not fruitful and which is not seen to be a good return on contributions paid by tax payers will also make people a lot more willing to pay.\"\nMeanwhile back in Bangalore, Shankarantha is busy playing the beats on his drums.\nBut he says he is just happy that people are responding and Bangalore's council is getting more taxes out of it.","summary":"The band of drummers, with their matching shirts and bright bandanas, is beating out a fast-paced tattoo to a small appreciative audience.","id":"22772431"}

She resisted,\" wrote Yishan Wong.\n\"She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems. I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicise Reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight.\"\nReddit attracted more than 163 million visitors last month, according to its own figures, making it one of the net's most popular destinations.\nMr Huffman co-founded Reddit in 2005 and was announced as the site's new chief last week, following Ms Pao's resignation.\nIn a message posted to the site on Tuesday, he said his top priority was to develop a \"comprehensive content policy\" and tools to enforce it.\n\"The overwhelming majority of content on Reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes Reddit great,\" he wrote.\n\"There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don't have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.\n\"We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I'll be hosting an AMA [Ask Me Anything session] on Thursday.\"\nMore than 14,000 comments have been posted below the announcement by the site's users. Some support his action, others suggest it will destroy the community.\nSeveral members said they now intended to switch to Voat - a rival site that promises to \"not meddle and not censor content\" unless it is illegal.\nOne analyst said it was inevitable that Mr Huffman's plans would antagonise many of Reddit's users, but added that was not necessarily a bad thing.\n\"When you try to formalise things that have emerged as an organic mess, there is absolutely a risk that you are going to lose a lot of the core of what you were and alienate a big bunch of users,\" said Mark Mulligan, from Midia Research.\n\"But Reddit has had a couple of years of incredibly strong growth in terms of profile and influence, and in many ways this is a good time to take this gamble, because it has momentum.\n\"If you have momentum, you can afford to lose a sub-segment of a generation of users because you can be confident of attracting a new generation and so can mould the company to better fit the owners' and management team's moral compasses.\"","summary":"Reddit's new chief executive has confirmed he plans to take fresh action against parts of the site containing offensive and obscene content.","id":"33536930"}

{"document":"If Scots were to be seven dwarves, that's what they might be called. (Until the nation's cynics get to work, of course.)\nInstead, they are the attributes with which Scotland's tourism agency is seeking to engage Scots and their spirit in making the country more attractive to visitors.\nThere's a lot to do if VisitScotland and the industry are to hit an ambitious target. And it's one of the sectors that needs to succeed if Scotland is to turn around a formidable rise in its trade imbalance.\nThe trade imbalance may not matter much, so long as Scotland is tied into the pound and part of the UK.\nBut it is a useful indicator of economic health, and rather important to those who want to see another independence referendum.\nThe Scottish government's figures for the whole Scottish economy have just been published, to cover the third quarter of last year, up to September.\nThey show that, between July and September, Scots sold Â£6.1bn of goods and services overseas. They imported Â£5.1bn. That's a trade surplus, while the UK as a whole is running some very large external trade deficits.\nSo that can't be bad for Scotland. But what about trade within the UK?\nScots sold goods and services worth Â£10.4bn in the third quarter to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The flow coming the other way was rather larger: Â£15.2bn.\nThe trade deficit with the rest of the UK rose to Â£14bn in 2014, from an economy with total output of nearly Â£140bn.\nJohn McLaren, a keen observer of these numbers, who used to work for Public Finance Scotland, observes that the first nine months of last year saw that deteriorate sharply.\nRoughly Â£750m less was being sold to the rest of the UK, and Â£750m more was being bought from it.\nThe fall in sales success to this dominant market, McLaren points out, has real implications for prosperity and jobs.\nExports and imports, overseas and to the rUK, combined to reach a deficit in the third quarter of Â£4.25bn, the highest quarter on record.\nWhen the fourth quarter figures are published, the annual total is probably going to be above Â£15bn.\nThe previous record was as recession struck in 2008, at just under Â£12bn. And it would mean that the imbalance has ballooned by Â£6bn since 2013.\nMcLaren has been looking at another angle on this, illustrated by these most recent statistics - the relative position of Scotland and the rUK in total output, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nThe third quarter saw that rise by 0.6%, after falling in the first half of the year.\nWhat, then, if Scotland were to have a geographical share of offshore oil and gas? Surely that would help? Well, no, it would show GDP falling by 0.8%, due to the falling prices of barrels and therms.\nGDP per head, with oil, was 1% lower than the rest of the UK.

And when a share of oil and gas is added, that rises by Â£2,100.\nThe catch is that much of that money is flowing out of the country in profits.

But only 35 constituency seats are directly elected by the 3.8 million registered voters.\nAnother 30 seats, called \"functional constituencies\", represent particular professions or trades and only people connected to those professions or trades can cast votes for those seats.\nThat is about 6% of the population, and they are mostly Beijing-leaning.\nRepresentatives for a further five functional constituencies, known as \"super seats\" are chosen by voters across the territory.\nThe vote does not elect Hong Kong's chief executive, the head of government, but many analysts believe the outcome could have an impact on whether China supports current leader CY Leung for a second term in office.","summary":"A new generation of pro-democracy activists has won seats on Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo).","id":"37273238"}

{"document":"In a letter urging congregations to vote on 7 May, the House of Bishops does not endorse a political party but encourages debate on issues such as nuclear defence and the economy.\nIt speaks of Britain's \"almost moribund political culture\".\nConservative MP Conor Burns said the letter was \"naive\", but David Cameron said he welcomed the move.\nThe 52-page letter - an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops - says \"it is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us\".\nThe Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said there was \"disengagement with the contemporary political culture\" and rejected the pleas of some, such as comedian and actor Russell Brand, for people not to vote.\nHe told reporters: \"We as bishops are not as sexy as Russell Brand but we say 'do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess'.\"\nThe letter says the country needs \"a new approach to political life that will change the political weather as decisively as did the administrations of 1945 and 1979\".\n\"The ideals that the Big Society stood for should not be consigned to the political dustbin,\" the letter adds.\nThe Big Society was among the Conservatives' flagship 2010 election policies and encouraged greater personal responsibility and community activism in shaping society and running public services.\nBut by January 2013 charities expressed \"huge frustration\" at a lack of progress with the idea, which they said appeared to be \"going nowhere\".\nThe document covers various issues including:\nThe bishops are well aware that their pre-election letter will be seen by some as a left-wing document - although they have been at pains to stress that their intention is not to back one party over another, nor to create a wish-list of policies - although they do ask voters to back the \"living wage\".\nThey say that the two UK administrations that offered genuinely new visions - Clement Attlee's Labour party in 1945 and Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 - changed the way people in Britain looked at society, politics and the role of government and human relationships - but that today, neither vision addresses contemporary needs, at a time of increasing public alienation from mainstream politics.\nIn recent weeks, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury have asked questions about the increasing divides between North and South, or richest and poorest in the UK.\nSo this latest intervention, questioning what kind of society an increasingly diverse Britain wants to be, and what kind of power it wishes to wield on the world stage, is a sign of a Church more willing to use its position to speak truth unto power, even if it is not always welcomed.\nConservative MP Nadine Dorries said she believed the letter had \"glaring inaccuracies\" regarding the economy and the Church should be more concerned with issues people wanted to hear its views on, such as abortion.\nShe said the bishops had a \"very definite left-wing leaning to their message\".\nHowever, the prime minister said he was \"keen for anyone to intervene in politics\".\nMr Cameron said: \"We want to have a political debate in this country.\n\"We've created an economy with genuine growth, real jobs and real security and I would say to the bishops, I would hope they would welcome that.\"\nLabour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have not commented on the letter.\nBut Stephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, tweeted that he welcomed the \"thoughtful and authentically Christian reflection on the election debate\".\nConor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said the letter was \"naive\" in not taking into account the recession and the risk posed by countries like Iran.\nPaul Whiteley, professor of government at the University of Essex, said the letter's policies were a combination of the Green Party, SNP and \"perhaps a bit of Labour\".\nHe said it had been a \"long time since the Church of England aligned with the Conservative Party\".\nThe director of public affairs for the Archbishops' Council, Malcolm Brown, rejected suggestions the letter was an attack on coalition policies and criticised responses to the document.\n\"The media response is to interpret it as an attack on the coalition,\" he said.\n\"David Cameron has reacted as if the letter was a rehash of earlier disputes about welfare reform.\n\"In short, the bishops have been thoroughly vindicated.

East Africa, the region most affected by killings for ivory, has experienced around a 50% reduction in numbers.\nHowever it is not the only cause of concern to the authors.\n\"We are particularly concerned about major infrastructure projects that are cutting up the elephant ranges, this is a particular problem for road development in central and east Africa,\" said Dr Chris Thouless, one of the report's authors.\n\"These are all major issues that will have to be dealt with once the poaching crisis is over.\"\nWhile report highlights the losses there are also some gains.\nElephant populations in South Africa, Namibia and Uganda have all increased.  Elephant ranges have expanded in Kenya and Botswana, with community based conservation showing real success in Northern Kenya.\nWhile these are positives, the overall picture is one of dramatic decline, fuelled by criminal activity that would decimate these giant creatures, if continued.\n\"Larger quantities of illegal ivory are leaving Africa than ever before,\" said Ginette Hemley from WWF.\n\"The transnational crime syndicates driving the slaughter must be dismantled, and consumer demand for ivory cannot persist if we hope to secure a safe future for elephants.\"\nThe report comes as the Cites meeting here in Johannesburg is facing significant division on how to handle the poaching crisis.\nTalks on extra protections for elephants will begin on Monday with a number of countries led by Kenya seeking extra protection.\nOthers, including Namibia and Zimbabwe, are seeking to liberalise the safeguards and open up a trade in ivory.

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe ultimate childhood tennis dream had been realised in one perfect draw - a Wimbledon wildcard leading to the British teenager facing the legendary Martina Navratilova on Centre Court.\nIt was 1994 and set to be nine-time champion Navratilova's farewell appearance in singles at the All England Club.\nWorld number 360 Taylor, then 19, was steadily climbing the rankings, had just beaten a player in the top 50 at Eastbourne and would normally have had the unwavering support of the home crowd.\nBut ruining a legend's day would not have gone down well.\n\"When we came out they gave her a standing ovation for what seemed like forever, so I stood at the net like a doughnut waiting for her,\" Taylor, now Claire Shepherd after marrying Dean in 2013, told BBC Sport.\n\"It didn't stop; it was incredible. I was just stood there and the umpire said: 'It's OK, this doesn't normally happen.'\n\"The crowd were definitely pro-Martina, but they were still supportive of me.\n\"It is just a bit of a regret that my career highlight was losing a match. I don't like that really, but it was Martina on Centre Court.\"\nNow a tennis coach, Shepherd, 42, is still very much in love with the sport and remains a regular visitor to SW19, having been hooked long before she became Oxfordshire county champion at the age of 10.\nShe used go to the All England Club with her tennis-mad father Phil and join the queuing masses to get tickets, so being out on the showpiece court in front of millions watching on television felt \"very strange\".\nThe Banbury-born left-hander had made her Wimbledon debut in the ladies' doubles in 1993. But this was something else.\n\"We had queued many times to watch Martina so to play her was amazing,\" the former British number two added. \"My first thought was: 'Wow, that's great.' Then, it was: 'No hold on, that's a terrible draw.'\"\nThe innocence of youth certainly helped to deal with facing one of the greatest players ever to pick up a racquet. Navratilova won a total of 18 singles Grand Slam titles during her astonishing career.\nShe may have been 37, but she was the world number four and still a dominant force on the All England grass, which was effectively her home turf.\n\"I was a little bit blasÃ©,\" Shepherd explained. \"At 19, you have a certain amount of naivety and just want to get on and do it. You just play the ball; it doesn't matter who is at the other end.\n\"I didn't think: 'I'm going to win, it's all fine.' It is difficult to have that bravado when you respect someone that much. But I didn't think: 'I'm going to get absolutely hammered.'\n\"I was well aware of how incredibly good Martina was. I would have to have had a lot of things fall in my favour but there was always that chance.\n\"I knew I was playing well; I had won a lot of matches and beaten Shaun Stafford, who was top 50 in the world, in the build-up. There was no point worrying about what she was doing.\"\nShepherd struggled to settle early on and trailed 5-1 in the first set. But she won four of the next seven games.\n\"I was leading 3-2 in the second because I broke her,\" said mother-of-two Shepherd. \"But she stepped it up a gear and that was the end of it really.\"\nNavratilova won that first-round match 6-2 6-3 and went on to the final before losing to Spain's Conchita Martinez. It was not quite the legend's final singles appearance at Wimbledon, as a wildcard gave her the chance to return in 2004, when she reached round two.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFor Shepherd, it was back to the \"undertour\" as she tried to build on her successful career at junior level, which really got going at a national level around the age of 16.\nIt was around then that Taylor started to reap the rewards of an attacking philosophy, an approach that brought her the title of junior national champion at the age of 18.\n\"My dad always encouraged me to play aggressive tennis and go for my shots,\" said Shepherd, who now coach aspiring juniors at Virgin Active in Chiswick, west London. \"He said that it would take a bit of time for more balls to land in than went out and that started to happen.\"\nShe continued to progress, pushing towards the top 150 in the world, playing singles at Wimbledon two more times, becoming British number two, and winning several lower-tier titles.\nA senior national title eluded her, although she was a runner-up, before an ongoing elbow injury meant she had to retire in 2000 at the age of 25.\n\"I had tried to come back, but the injury never healed,\" Shepherd said. \"It was really difficult. I just loved playing and was always so positive. I felt lost but I threw myself into coaching.\"\nShe had to give up her second career for a time to bring up her two young children after getting divorced. Harry is now 16 and Mathew 13 and, although both are sporty, they are not tennis-obsessed. It's the best juniors at her west London workplace who benefit from her expertise.\nThe next generation have widespread access to facilities and affordable coaching that often eluded youngsters during the 1980s and 90s. The budding Shepherd had to wait until dusk to get court time because juniors were way down the priority list.\nThat has changed in recent years and British tennis, with Andy Murray and Johanna Konta leading the way, is enjoying a boom period.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I'm very fortunate doing what I do,\" Shepherd said. \"Most of the juniors I teach have aspirations to achieve something in tennis.\"\nAnd her own memories and love of all things Wimbledon remain as strong as ever.\n\"In 2012, I worked for the LTA for a while and went on before matches to do on-court demonstrations,\" she said. \"All the emotion came back.\n\"People have dreams but not everyone gets to live them out. I lived it out and when I walked out I was sobbing. The children were looking at me and thinking: 'Why is that woman crying?'\"\nBut the standout moment of 1994 is a non-tennis one.\n\"What made the day was that after the match and the interviews Martina talked to my mum [Janet] and dad, who were allowed to sit in on her press conference,\" Shepherd recalled.\n\"For someone of her stature to do that was the most impressive thing. It meant so much to my mum and dad.\n\"She didn't have to to do it. I wasn't even there so it wasn't for show; she is just a genuinely nice person, as well as an incredible tennis player.\"","summary":"Feeling like a \"doughnut\" while she waited for the biggest day of her career to get going wasn't really in Claire Taylor's planning.","id":"40406882"}
{"document":"On a summer's evening, beside the River Seine, outside a beautifully idiosyncratic bookshop, a current crop of American creative writing students are listening to readings.\nThese students from New York University (NYU) are in Paris for a month as part of their studies - immersing themselves in the literary culture of the French capital.\nAccompanied by their teaching staff, the students use the city as a giant writing workshop.\nThe cafes, art galleries, the readings and the Parisian streets become the material for their exercises in fiction and poetry. It must be the most de-luxe cure for writers' block, while still racking up credits towards a degree.\nIt's such an idyllic setting, listening to readings and discussions, in the shadow of Notre Dame, outside the classic Shakespeare and Company shop-front, that the only natural reaction is one of overwhelming jealousy.\nIt's not only NYU which brings its students here. There are other universities and institutions, from the US, the UK and Australia. The Left Bank is becoming a field-trip centre for trainee bohemians.\nIt's also a reflection of how higher education - costing up to $50,000 (ÃÂ£32,000) per year in the US - has become about experiences as much as qualifications.\nBut what difference does this kind of Parisian trip make to their writing?\n\"It's good to escape the familiar. You see the world fresh, often with intense clarity,\" says Deborah Landau, an award-winning poet and director of NYU's creative writing programme.\n\"Paris has always been a city for writers; generations of novelists and poets have flocked to Paris seeking inspiration and literary camaraderie.\"\nAnd she says the students can be inspired by the \"sensory pleasures\" of the city - whether it's the food, wine, art, music or the small bookstores. \"Lingering over coffee for hours in the cafes is absolutely encouraged.\"\nStudents also have a line-up of novelists and poets to act as tutors.\nThe university has added a \"low residency\" postgraduate course - taught in intensive blocks rather than full terms.\n'Outside their lives'\nThis includes five 10-day stretches in Paris - and novelist Helen Schulman says this is where it can really make a difference for students.\n\"They're on a different hamster wheel, they're so outside of their lives. They're away from their work, their families, all the things that press upon them, they get a chance to follow their dream of writing. And for a grown-up, it's a way of doing that without leaving their job or losing their family,\" she says.\nYoung writers coming to Paris follow in the footsteps of the likes of James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Francis Scott Fitzgerald and Samuel Beckett.\nAnd the Shakespeare and Company bookshop used by the NYU students is a living link to that legacy.\nThis current shop in the Latin Quarter is the second incarnation. The first was run by Sylvia Beach, a US-born bookseller who published Ulysses by James Joyce in 1922 - when more or less everyone else had turned it down.\nThis was the hang-out for writers such as Hemingway and Fitzgerald, before it was shut down during the Nazi occupation.\nWhen Sylvia Beach died, the name of the shop and its commitment to writers was taken over in the 1950s by another American bookseller in Paris, George Whitman.\nIt's now run by his daughter, Sylvia Whitman, the inheritor of the kind of ramshackle bookshop that is so photogenic that you would want to use it as a movie set.\nIn fact, Woody Allen did just that, using the shop, with its overflowing bookshelves, in his own cinematic tribute to literary ghosts, Midnight in Paris.\nThe dog-eared hardbacks in the shop's library include copies that used to be owned by the likes of Graham Greene and Jean Paul Sartre.\nIt's not all show. Young writers can stay here for free - and thousands have done so over the decades.\n\"We try to support them, give them a bed and some food, to be a home away from home.\n\"We could commercialise, but there are more important things,\" says Sylvia Whitman, who herself has something of a pre-war spectral look.\nThe previous Shakespeare and Company was closed down because Sylvia Beach refused to sell her last copy of Finnegan's Wake to a German officer.\nAnd you get the impression that any other intruding official would still get the same treatment today.\nThe idea of bringing students to Paris also reflects the competition between the ever-growing number of creative writing courses. And it means balancing the literary themes with the literary theme park.\nIn the UK alone, there are now more than 700 different creative writing degrees on offer, often in combination with other subjects, including accounting and creative writing, human bioscience and creative writing and creative writing and sports management.\nFor many years, almost the only place in the UK offering a creative writing degree was the University of East Anglia, which began teaching the subject in 1970.\nThe university's current director of creative writing, novelist Andrew Cowan, says that from relative rarity, the subject has spread rapidly in the past 15 years.\nAmong the reasons he suggests is that English literature degrees had become so abstruse and theoretical that creative writing allowed students to return to talking about authors and books.\n\"Creative writing puts the author back in the centre of the picture.\"\nThe place of creative writing has now been established within the publishing industry, he says. Literary agents and publishers are waiting at the end of the graduate conveyor belt.\nIt's hard to imagine an author like Hemingway fitting into that world. But he probably provided the set text for what the would-be student writers take away from Paris.\n\"If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.\"","summary":"Forget any images of creative writing groups on metal chairs in draughty community centres, the business of learning to write has developed into something much more lavish.","id":"18725140"}

{"document":"More mothers now need surgery to deliver a baby due to their narrow pelvis size, according to a study.\nResearchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today.\nHistorically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour.\nResearchers in Austria say the trend is likely to continue, but not to the extent that non-surgical births will become obsolete.\nDr Philipp Mitteroecker, of the department of theoretical biology at the University of Vienna, said there was a long standing question in the understanding of human evolution.\n\"Why is the rate of birth problems, in particular what we call fetopelvic disproportion - basically that the baby doesn't fit through the maternal birth canal - why is this rate so high?\" he said.\n\"Without modern medical intervention such problems often were lethal and this is, from an evolutionary perspective, selection.\n\"Women with a very narrow pelvis would not have survived birth 100 years ago. They do now and pass on their genes encoding for a narrow pelvis to their daughters.\"\nIt has been a long standing evolutionary question why the human pelvis has not grown wider over the years.\nThe head of a human baby is large compared with other primates, meaning animals such as chimps can give birth relatively easily.\nThe researchers devised a mathematical model using data from the World Health Organization and other large birth studies.\nThey found opposing evolutionary forces in their theoretical study.\nOne is a trend towards larger newborns, which are more healthy.\nHowever, if they grow too large, they get stuck during labour, which historically would have proved disastrous for mother and baby, and their genes would not be passed on.\n\"One side of this selective force - namely the trend towards smaller babies - has vanished due to Caesarean sections,\" said Dr Mitteroecker.\n\"Our intent is not to criticise medical intervention,\" he said. \"But it's had an evolutionary effect. \"\nThe researchers estimated that the global rate of cases where the baby could not fit through the maternal birth canal was 3%, or 30 in 1,000 births.\nOver the past 50 or 60 years, this rate has increased to about 3.3-3.6%, so up to 36 in 1,000 births.\nThat is about a 10-20% increase of the original rate, due to the evolutionary effect.\n\"The pressing question is what's going to happen in the future?\" Dr Mitteroecker said.\n\"I expect that this evolutionary trend will continue but perhaps only slightly and slowly.\n\"There are limits to that. So I don't expect that one day the majority of children will have to be born by [Caesarean] sections.\"\nThe research is published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nCommenting on the study, Smithsonian paleoanthropologist Dr Briana Pobiner said there are \"probably many other biological and cultural issues that factor into the Caesarean sections rate, which varies widely across the developed and developing world\".\nAnd Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians, said factors such as diabetes and obesity, are having an impact on the number of Caesarean sections.\n\"I think what is important to take into the [question of] evolution is that things like diabetes are much more common at a younger age so we see many more women of reproductive age who have diabetes,\" she said.\n\"That has consequences as to whether or not they may need a caesarean section.\n\"In addition, the rates of obesity are increasing so more and more women of reproductive age have a higher body mass index and this again has an impact on caesarean section rates.\"\nFollow Helen on Twitter.","summary":"The regular use of Caesarean sections is having an impact on human evolution, say scientists.","id":"38210837"}

{"document":"The first-stage booster, which was previously used on a mission 11 months ago, helped send a telecommunications satellite into orbit from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.\nIt marks an important milestone for SpaceX in its quest for re-usability.\nTraditionally, rockets are expendable - their various segments are discarded and destroyed during an ascent.\nThe California outfit, in contrast, aims to recover Falcon first-stages and fly them multiple times to try to reduce the cost of its operations.\nAnd to emphasise this point, Thursday's booster was also brought back under control to land on a barge stationed out in the Atlantic.\n\"I think it's an amazing day for space,\" said Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX.\n\"It means you can fly and re-fly an orbit class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket. This is going to be, hopefully, a huge revolution in spaceflight.\"\nThe lift-off had occurred on cue at 18:27 EDT (22:27 GMT; 23:27 BST).\nThe satellite passenger, SES-10, was ejected some 32 minutes later.\nThis spacecraft is now being manoeuvred by its own thruster system to a position over the equator from where it can deliver TV and telecom services to the Caribbean, Brazil, and other regions in Central and South America.\nSpaceX has become adept in the past two years at bringing first-stage boosters home after they have completed their primary task of getting a payload out of the thicker lower-reaches of the atmosphere.\nThe segments autonomously guide themselves back to the floating platform or a coastal pad to make propulsive landings.\nThursday's mission was the first time one of these \"flight proven\" vehicles had been re-launched.\nOther landed boosters will now be used on future missions. Another six this year, most likely.\nSome customers may still insist on a brand new rocket, but if SpaceX can demonstrate routine, untroubled performance from these second-hand vehicles then satellite operators will get increasingly comfortable with the concept.\nGetting away from expendable rockets has been a long quest.\nFamously, Nasa's space shuttle system was partially re-usable.\nIts white solid-fuel strap-on boosters, for example, would parachute into the Atlantic after each launch. The casings of these boosters were then refurbished and re-used numerous times.\nAnd yet the complexities of servicing the shuttle system after every flight swamped any savings.\nSpaceX hopes its simpler Falcon 9 rocket can finally deliver a practical commercial solution. It believes its technology will eventually permit rapid turnaround, with boosters flying perhaps 10 times before being retired; maybe even up to 100 times with a certain level of refurbishment.\n\"With this being the first re-light we were incredibly paranoid about everything,\" Mr Musk said.\n\"The core airframe remained the same, the engines remained the same - but any auxiliary components that we thought might be slightly questionable, we changed out. Now our aspiration will be zero hardware changes, re-flight in 24 hours - the only thing that changes is that we reload propellant.\"\nSpaceX hopes its simpler Falcon 9 rocket can finally deliver a practical commercial solution. It believes its technology will eventually permit rapid turnaround, with boosters flying multiple times before being retired.\nOther players are following close behind. The Amazon entrepreneur Jeff Bezos already has a re-usable sub-orbital rocket and capsule system that he has successfully launched and landed five times.\nMr Bezos now plans a recoverable orbital rocket called New Glenn. And United Launch Alliance, which puts up the majority of America's national security payloads, is in the process of designing a new vehicle that will return its engines to Earth via parachute.\nAll this is welcome news for the likes of Luxembourg satellite operator SES, which is having to queue up for rocket rides and wait many months to get its valuable telecoms spacecraft in orbit and earning revenue.\n\"It's a big deal for us. If we can get reliable re-usability then we will get better management of the manifest,\" said Martin Halliwell, the chief technology officer for SES.\n\"We made a little bit of history today, actually.

{"document":"First of all, there was an apology to customers for the failings of the past. Then there was the announcement of an ethical review. Then a lot of detail about the chief executive's pay and suggestions that the bank may consider blocking future bonus payments that, frankly, were unlikely to be paid out in any case.\nBut it isn't until you get into the guts of the Co-op Bank's annual report and accounts that you understand the true challenges facing the organisation. With tissue-thin capital buffers, there is no room for error.\nOne sentence jumps out. \"The year-end Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 7.2% is below prior guidance.\"\nThis is the key test of a bank's capital position and, therefore, security - the amount of money it has readily available to absorb shocks.\nIt is just above the level at which the Bank of England could force the Co-op into emergency resolution, taking over assets and enforcing losses on investors which include the Co-op Group.\nThe Co-op Bank says it is confident it can raise the necessary capital to avoid such a situation.\nThe bank is in a position where it is wholly reliant on its investors stumping up the necessary millions of pounds agreed in the refinancing which saw the Co-op Group's stake fall to 30%.\nCo-op Group - itself facing mammoth losses - is still due to make payments of Â£100m by the end of June and Â£163m by the end of the year.\nAnd that is before the small matter of the Â£400m extra fund-raising announced last month that the Co-op still needs to get away.\nThe cost-income ratio at the bank has also flown upwards, from 73.7% in 2012 to 93.6% in 2013. On average, banks like to see a cost-to-income ratio closer to 50%.\nIt is clear that the Co-op Bank is becoming increasingly expensive to run, as the balance sheet contracts and the complexity of unravelling previous problems weighs on costs.\nSome brutally honest points are made in the accounts. \"The bank does not have a track record in successfully executing large scale changes\"; the board \"needs to be strengthened\"; the split from the Co-op Group is proving more costly than previously thought and cost reductions - including redundancies - may not be achieved. Any failure and that tissue-thin capital buffer could be torn through.\nThe Bank of England will apply its own stress tests to the Co-op in the summer.

Despite the adverse publicity of a former chairman who didn't appear to know basic information about the bank's balance sheet and then was filmed apparently taking drugs, customers have remained remarkably loyal.\nThe number of current account and business customers are up slightly. Customers still appear to attach a good deal of importance to the bank's \"ethical\" stance, despite the calamities of the last year.\nNiall Booker, the Co-op's chief executive, professes himself confident that UBS can successfully complete the vital Â£400m fund-raising.

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nEven fewer could have imagined just how the game would ebb and flow, and ultimately provide Aberdeen with their first chance in 17 years to win a cup they treated as their own in the eighties.\nIn 1990, as Alex McLeish lifted the trophy just as Willie Miller had done four times in the preceding decade, it would have seemed inconceivable they would not do so again.\nBut those are the bare facts. And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.\nAnd yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.\nTheir desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.\nBut it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.\nThe ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.\nThe introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.\nAgain his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.\nThat equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.\nThe Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.\nBut Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.\nMcInnes's assertion that they were deserved winners is a generous one, but they stuck steadfastly to their task and though Jonny Hayes' winner had a huge slice of luck attached to it, Aberdeen now have the opportunity to make amends for a tame League Cup final showing earlier in the season.\nAfter the match, Lennon declined to accept the tag of gallant losers, insisting his team were simply losers.\nIt's a harsh assessment but an indication of the standards the Hibs manager demands - and will continue to demand - from his side.\nLennon has not amassed the medals he has won as a player and manager by accepting second-best, which is what his side were by some distance in the opening half-hour.\nBut he can take solace - on reflection - in the manner his team dug in to give the country's second-best team quite a fright.\nHe can now turn his attention fully to building for next season's return to the Premiership. A few astute signings could ensure they are challenging in the upper half of the table this time next year.\nFor Derek McInnes, though, the short-term requires his full attention. Second place in the Premiership looks a safe bet, though not yet an absolute certainty.\nBut he and his players could make a real name for themselves back at Hampden on 27 May if they can end the 27-year wait to reclaim the Scottish Cup.","summary":"Few observers predicted anything other than a closely-fought match between the Championship winners and the second-best team in the country.","id":"39680749"}

{"document":"Abbey Road is full of gremlins.\nGiles Martin - son of record producer George Martin - can't play any music through his mixing desk at the iconic North London studios.\nHe re-boots his computer while two engineers crawl on the floor, plugging in cables and fiddling with various switches. At one point, someone unplugs a hard drive.\n\"Oh God, you've just deleted the Beatles,\" Martin deadpans.\nEventually, the equipment springs to life. The producer dismisses a workman, who has appeared to drill locks into the door, and apologises for the delay.\n\"I just moved into this studio yesterday,\" he explains.\nWith that, Martin loads up a file that contains dozens of versions of the Beatles' back catalogue. There are the original recordings, mono mixes, stereo remasters and various other snippets - all of which Martin can flick between at will.\nHe used these tracks as a reference while producing a new DVD compilation, Beatles 1+, which sees the Fab Four's biggest hits re-imagined in stereo and 5.1 surround sound, accompanied by restored promotional videos and films.\n\"The goal is to bring the band closer to you,\" says Martin. \"To have that same feeling at home that I get when I put on the tapes in the studio.\"\nRather than viewing the originals as sacred, the band appreciate their music being tweaked this way, he says.\n\"My dad went to see John Lennon in 1980 before he died, and John said to him: 'Do you know what I'd really like to do? I'd love to record everything again.'\n\"Dad said, 'Really? How about Strawberry Fields?'\n\"And John said: 'Especially Strawberry Fields.'\"\nCounter-intuitively, Martin's new mixes are often simpler than the existing stereo versions - but he has a solid explanation.\nUp to Yellow Submarine, the Beatles treated the mono mixes of their albums as the definitive documents. The stereo versions were created as an afterthought, often without the band's involvement.\n\"My dad was never happy with the extreme panning that went on,\" explains the producer. \"You'd have the band on one side and all the vocals on the other.\n\"And you have what I call the socks and sandals brigade saying: 'The only way to listen to Sgt Pepper's is in mono.' To be honest, they're probably right, but no-one does that any more.\"\nSo he set about recapturing the power of those mono recordings. \"In Beatles world, if you can make something more aggressive, they want it more aggressive,\" Martin says, cueing up Paperback Writer to prove his point.\n\"If you listen, this mono mix is very crunchy, very in your face,\" he says, as the textured harmonies give way to Paul McCartney's guitar riff.\n\"The stereo sounds wider,\" Martin continues, switching seamlessly to that version, \"but the problem is that all the action - the guitar and drums - are on the left speaker.\"\n\"The guitar riff is what you remember about that song,\" he says, but it loses its oomph by being shifted to one side. Accordingly, the new mix puts the instruments into a focussed central point, while spreading the vocals across the front speakers.\nThe rear speakers present a separate challenge. Rather than placing Ringo's drums behind the listener, or making vocals circle the room, Martin opts for restraint.\n\"Dolby came to see me with 5.1 when it was new,\" he explains, \"and they'd mixed What's Going On by Marvin Gaye in surround sound, with the guitar coming out of the right rear speaker.\n\"But if you went to see Marvin Gaye performing and his guitar player decided to stand at the back of the audience with his amp, you'd go: 'Could you put him on the stage, please?'\"\nOver-using those rear channels is \"really distracting,\" Martin argues, so he came up with an ingenious solution. He went into Abbey Road's Studio 2, wired up a \"really big\" loudspeaker and played the original Beatles recordings at full volume.\n\"We acted like the band were playing in there again, and recorded the walls using the original Beatles microphones,\" he says. Those reverberations and echoes were then placed into the rear speakers to give \"the illusion of being in the room with the band\".\n\"And they are really good as a band,\" Martin says. \"That sounds stupid, but they do actually make a good sound. You want to get the least stuff between that and what's at home.\"\nWith the later Beatles recordings, however, he had more opportunity to be playful.\n\"Strawberry Fields is more of a sound picture than a song,\" Martin says, scrolling over to John Lennon's masterpiece, and locating the descending svarmandal figure (the one that sounds like a sitar) between the first chorus and second verse.\n\"On the stereo remaster, the svarmandal does something cool - it pans. So in our new version, we can steal that and make it even better. Now it goes around all five speakers like a horseshoe.\"\nBut Martin also made a more elemental tweak.\n\"The mono Strawberry Fields - the one the Beatles mixed - is slightly more intense and more condensed. There's a mellotron pulse under John's voice which forms a sort of harmonic for his vocal. In the stereo it's off to one side and, as a result, John's voice sounds thinner.\n\"I said: 'OK, if we're doing a new mix of this, we should do one that sounds like the mono. So we came up with this,\" he says, pressing play on the updated version which, it has to be said, sounds much more fulsome.\nIn making such decisions, Martin tried to put himself into the mindset of John, Paul, Ringo and the two Georges as they worked - just metres away from where he's sitting - in the 1960s.\n\"All of the songs should sound like you remember them,\" he says. \"It's not meant to be the 'Giles Martin version'. I work for the Beatles.\"\nMartin confesses to one glaring mistake: The stereo mix of Lennon and McCartney's kitchen sink symphony A Day In The Life is missing a piano, because he opted to use the version created for the Cirque Du Soleil show, Love.\n\"All of these fans will be going: 'Why did you take this piano off?' And the answer is I didn't - I just used the Love version,\" he cringes.\nMartin is modest about his achievements, saying more than once that \"there's no talent in what I do\". And he admits his every decision will be pored over by Beatles obsessives.\n\"There are people who know this material better than I do,\" he says. \"But generally I get a pretty good ride. They know I do it because I care, rather than showboating and going: 'This is how I think they should sound.'\"\nUltimately, he would have liked to be more inventive with the surround mixes but had to \"rein myself in, because these are the Beatles number one hits\".\n\"If I was doing a 5.1 of the White Album, though? Let me at it!\"\nThe Beatles 1+ is out now.","summary":"Giles Martin reveals how he took The Beatles master tapes and remixed them in surround sound for the Fab Four's new video collection.","id":"34766693"}

{"document":"Online security specialists Cloudflare said it recorded the \"biggest\" attack of its kind on Monday.\nHackers used weaknesses in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a system used to synchronise computer clocks, to flood servers with huge amounts of data.\nThe technique could potentially be used to force popular services offline.\nSeveral experts had predicted that the NTP would be used for malicious purposes.\nThe target of this latest onslaught is unknown, but it was directed at servers in Europe, Cloudflare said.\nAttackers used a well-known method to bring down a system known as Denial of Service (DoS) - in which huge amounts of data are forced on a target, causing it to fall over.\nCloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince said his firm had measured the \"very big\" attack at about 400 gigabits per second (Gbps), 100Gbps larger than an attack on anti-spam service Spamhaus last year.\nIn a report published three months ago, Cloudflare warned that attacks on the NTP were on the horizon and gave details of how web hosts could best try to protect their customers.\nNTP servers, of which there are thousands around the world, are designed to keep computers synchronised to the same time.\nThe fundamentals of the NTP began operating in 1985. While there have been changes to the system since then, it still operates in much the same way.\nA computer needing to synchronise time with the NTP will send a small amount of data to make the request. The NTP will then reply by sending data back.\nThe vulnerability lies with two weaknesses. Firstly, the amount of data the NTP sends back is bigger than the amount it receives, meaning an attack is instantly amplified.\nSecondly, the original computer's location can be \"spoofed\", tricking the NTP into sending the information back to somewhere else.\nIn this attack, it is likely that many machines were used to make requests to the NTP. Hackers spoofed their location so that the massive amounts of data from the NTP were diverted to a single target.\n\"Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive traffic load hitting a victim from around the internet,\" Cloudflare explained in a blog outlining the vulnerability, posted last month.\nThe NTP is one of several protocols used within the infrastructure of the internet to keep things running smoothly.\nUnfortunately, despite being vital components, most of these protocols were designed and implemented at a time when the prospect of malicious activity was not considered.\n\"A lot of these protocols are essential, but they're not secure,\" explained Prof Alan Woodward, an independent cyber-security consultant, who had also raised concerns over NTP last year.\n\"All you can really do is try and mitigate the denial of service attacks. There are technologies around to do it.\"\nMost effective, Prof Woodward suggested, was technology that was able to spot when a large amount of data was heading for one destination - and shutting off the connection.\nCloudflare's Mr Prince said that while his firm had been able to mitigate the attack, it was a worrying sign for the future.\n\"Someone's got a big, new cannon,\" he tweeted. \"Start of ugly things to come.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC","summary":"A massive attack that exploited a key vulnerability in the infrastructure of the internet is the \"start of ugly things to come\", it has been warned.","id":"26136774"}

{"document":"Reports say some protesters tried to enter the government building but were pushed back by police.\nThousands of protesters gathered on European Square again after a huge rally on Sunday - the biggest since the 2004 Orange Revolution.\nThey are angry at the government's decision not to sign a major trade and association deal with the EU.\nIn recent weeks the government has come under Russian pressure not to sign the pact, but to join a Russian-led customs union with former Soviet states instead.\nOpposition leaders, including world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, called the government's decision \"shameful\" and vowed to keep up mass protests in central Kiev indefinitely.\nThe activists included supporters of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, who urged the government to release her - a plea that has also been made by EU politicians.\nMs Tymoshenko wants to get treatment in Germany for chronic back pain and the EU has made her release a key condition for signing the pact with Kiev. But last week Ukraine's parliament rejected legislation that would have enabled her to go.\nMore than 100,000 people rallied in Kiev on Sunday, the opposition said. Police estimated the crowd at about 50,000.\nHundreds of protesters stayed in tents on the square overnight, despite an order from the authorities not to do so.\nTents were a big feature of the pro-Western Orange Revolution, which challenged Russia's traditional influence in Ukrainian politics.\nViktor Yanukovych is president now, having been elected in 2010, but back in 2004 he was toppled by the Orange Revolution after an election widely condemned as fraudulent.\nThe authorities have launched criminal proceedings against some activists who clashed with police on Sunday.\nBy David SternBBC News, Kiev\nThe crowds have diminished considerably after yesterday's gigantic and historic demonstration in central Kiev. But tensions have not lessened.\nMore confrontations between protesters and police early Monday morning in front of Ukraine's government building indicate that the situation remains very volatile.\nA few thousand people turned out on Monday, and around 200 spent the night on two main squares, where rallies continue today.\nIn an echo of the Orange Revolution nine years ago, protesters set up a tent camp in front of the main demonstration's stage.\nUkrainian opposition leaders say political actions will continue through the week until the Vilnius summit, where Ukrainian officials were supposed to sign the free trade agreement with the EU.\nMany demonstrators say that they believe President Viktor Yanukovych will succumb to the pressure of the rallies and complete another about-turn - and sign the agreement. This of course depends on whether the protesters can maintain their own momentum over the coming days.\nThe Interfax-Ukraine new agency said several hundred protesters gathered outside the government building on Monday and various objects \"started flying in the direction of the police\", prompting the police to don gas masks and form a human chain.\nSome activists told a BBC reporter at the scene that there were athletic-looking young people in the crowd whom they suspected of being agents provocateurs.\nIn addition to Vitali Klitschko, opposition leaders Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Oleh Tyahnybok addressed the crowd. They urged President Yanukovych to sack Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and to sign the association agreement with the EU.\nThe signing had been set for 29 November in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, where several other ex-Soviet states will forge closer ties with the EU.\nRussia has threatened unspecified economic measures if Ukraine signs the deal with the EU. In the past Moscow has suspended gas supplies, in disputes over prices, and this year it blocked imports of Ukrainian chocolates.\nRussia has also boycotted wine and mineral water from Georgia and Moldova - two other ex-Soviet states seeking favourable trade terms with the EU.\nIn television interviews on Sunday Mr Azarov accused the EU and International Monetary Fund of failing to offer Ukraine enough financial support.\nHe told Russian TV a letter from the IMF had been \"the last straw\" because the fund had linked the granting of a credit to \"conditions that were absolutely unacceptable to Ukraine, such as raising the tariffs for housing and utilities, freezing wages and pensions\".\nOn the EU, he said :\"We are being told: you carry on working and carry on moving forward but don't expect any money.\n\"So far we have only been given a verbal promise that in the next seven years Ukraine can expect 1bn euros [ÃÂ£835m; $1.3bn]. And what is 1bn euros? It is nothing,\" he said.\nUkraine depends on imports of Russian gas, but recently the supplier, Gazprom, complained that Ukraine had fallen behind in payments. Pipelines transiting through Ukraine pump Russian gas to many EU member states.\nMr Azarov told Ukrainian TV that Russia had promised to review the terms of its gas sales. However, Gazprom later denied that there was any such promise.","summary":"Ukrainian police have used tear gas in fresh clashes with pro-EU activists in the heart of Ukraine's capital Kiev.","id":"25085790"}

{"document":"Crashes similar to those suffered by Fernando Alonso in Australia on Sunday will be part of a risk assessment into the 'halo' device, planned for 2017.\nThe Spaniard's McLaren came to rest upside down after his 180mph crash at the season-opening race in Melbourne.\n\"We need to see if it could become more difficult to get out,\" he said.\nEven if the halo made it more difficult for a driver to get out of his car in such a situation, that would not be enough to prevent its introduction.\nThe device is being investigated on a holistic basis and the FIA will weigh any potential extra problems with a driver's ability to remove himself from the cockpit against the increased safety.\nBut only if the cons outweighed the pros would head protection be delayed.\nAlonso's team-mate Jenson Button said after the race that there was \"no need for him to get out in that situation\", adding: \"It's better to have a halo system. They [safety workers] would tip the car over of course to get him out, so it takes a bit longer. But he was OK so it doesn't matter.\"\nGoverning body the FIA is aiming to make a final decision on the adoption of the halo by the end of May, following the completion of the risk assessment.\nIts F1 director Charlie Whiting has told teams the device will be introduced if the process does not throw up any unanticipated risks and that he expects no opposition.\nEven if a team did object, the FIA could force it through on safety grounds.\nThe FIA is still waiting for all the data to be recovered from the accident data recorders on Alonso's car before investigating exactly what happened.\nThe 34-year-old double world champion sustained a peak force of 46G during the crash, which he described as the biggest of his career.\nIt was triggered when Alonso's right front wheel caught the left-rear wheel of Esteban Gutierrez's Haas as he was trying to overtake on the approach to Turn Three.\nAll cars are fitted with a high-speed camera pointing back towards the driver's head to analyse its trajectory during an accident.\nThe device works at 400 frames per second - 16 times faster than a normal camera - and it will reveal whether there would have been any danger to the driver's head had a halo been fitted.\nThis is considered highly unlikely, as the halo has been designed to be well out of reach of the helmet even in extreme scenarios.\nThese cameras, along with in-ear accelerometers worn by the drivers and data from sensors on the chassis, mean the FIA can build up a detailed picture of the events of an accident.\nAlonso, who is one of the vast majority of drivers backing the introduction of extra head protection, said it was important to look into what would have happened in his accident and its aftermath had a halo been fitted.\nThe risk assessment into the halo will focus on the potential negatives of the device, and whether they are worse than what would have happened to the driver if it had not been fitted.\nIf the positives outweigh the negatives more often than not, that will be considered a satisfactory situation for the introduction of the halo.\nDriver egress is only one of about nine different potential dangers that are part of the assessment.\nThe halo, which was tested by Ferrari during the final pre-season test in Spain, is not the only head-protection system under consideration.\nRed Bull has proposed an alternative solution, which has a similar elliptical loop above the driver's head but differs from the halo in having two side supports rather than one at the front and a screen around it.\nBut Whiting says that is \"considerably further behind in development, it's never been tested, but it could offer additional protection\".\nThe device may be ready for the FIA to test its efficacy in protecting against a flying wheel by the end of April.\nThe test fires a 20kg wheel and upright assembly at the car at 225km\/h. The device has to deflect it without breaking.\nThe screen is one of the biggest potential problems with the Red Bull device - it is unclear whether this would cause visibility problems as a result of collecting debris or in wet weather.","summary":"The ease with which drivers can get out of an upturned car will be investigated before finalising the introduction of head protection next year.","id":"35870589"}

Instead it is costing 575m euros.\nChanging all this requires a mix of vision,  toughness and dialogue, but the man whose job it is might have been purpose-picked to antagonise the unions.\nRadio France's new president Mathieu Gallet is handsome, young, energetic - and right-wing.\nOne of his previous jobs was in the culture ministry under President Nicholas Sarkozy.\nMr Gallet has warned that the corporation's annual deficit of 21m euros is unsustainable.\nHe wants a voluntary redundancy plan to shed 300 or so jobs.\nHe says that Radio France's two orchestras are one too many; that the separate news rooms at France Inter, France Info and France Culture need to be integrated; and that the network of local stations at France Bleu should commission shared material.\nBut all this has merely infuriated the unions at Radio France.\nThe hardliners there mainly represent technicians, although many journalists have also stopped work.\nThe strikers have made it quite clear that they want Mr Gallet to go.\nAnd usefully they have discovered that even as he was advising drastic cuts at the corporation, he spent 100,000 euros doing up his personal office there.\nIt is the sort of gaffe that could easily have brought him down.\nBut so far Mr Gallet continues with the backing of the Socialist government,  which presumably sees as well as he does the inevitability of reform.\nFor those of us who depended on France-Info's round-the-clock news output,  it is an infuriating time.\nThough the station has a discernible left-wing bias - the ratio of union leaders to company bosses interviewed must be about five to one - it is in general thorough and professional.\nIt is also, by comparison with private stations, mercifully light on adverts (though, for all its vaunted public sector ethos, Radio France does permit some).\nThe danger is that we news junkies will start looking elsewhere, and discovering the competition.","summary":"For three weeks the morning ritual for millions of people in France has been rudely interrupted by a strike at one of the country's great public sector institutions: Radio France.","id":"32209048"}

{"document":"In his Autumn Statement Philip Hammond said growth predictions had been cut as a result of the Brexit vote.\nAs widely expected, he unveiled a fuel duty freeze and more cash for housing, transport and digital infrastructure.\nLabour said the government was \"unprepared and ill-equipped\" for Brexit and had \"no vision\".\nMr Hammond told MPs the UK's deficit would no longer be cleared by 2020 - with the target instead \"as early as possible\" afterwards.\nMr Hammond said the statement - his first major Commons event as chancellor - came exactly five months after a Brexit vote which \"will change the course of Britain's history\", making it \"more urgent than ever\" to tackle long-term economic weaknesses.\nPresenting the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts, he said borrowing would hit Â£68.2bn this year and Â£59bn next year, compared with the March forecast of Â£55.5bn and Â£38.8bn.\nThe OBR said the referendum result meant potential growth in the current Parliament would be 2.4 percentage points lower than forecast in March. Government finances are forecast to be Â£122bn worse off than in the spring.\nAmong the chancellor's announcements were:\nMr Hammond said the government would prioritise \"additional high-value investment\" on infrastructure, which would be funded by additional borrowing.\nHe paid tribute to his predecessor George Osborne but said he would now follow three new fiscal rules: to balance the books \"as early as possible in the next Parliament\", for public sector net debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of Parliament and for welfare spending to be within a cap.\nThe OBR based its forecasts on the assumption that the UK would leave the EU in April 2019 - two years after the government's deadline for triggering negotiations with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\nIt also assumed new trading arrangements would slow import and export growth for a decade and that migration would be restricted.\nIt said the increased borrowing would result from weak tax receipts and lower than expected growth predictions as a result of June's vote to leave the European Union.\nBased on its assumptions around Brexit - the government has not yet revealed the details of its negotiating plan - it predicted the referendum result would account for an extra Â£58bn of borrowing.\nThis included a predicted Â£16bn increase as a result of lower migration and Â£18.1bn because of lower productivity growth.\nThe OBR said its forecasts for Brexit were \"uncertain\", and they were disputed by Conservative MP John Redwood, who said: \"Their forecast probably is too low, their borrowing forecast is far too high, and we'll get good access to the single market once we're out of the EU.\"\nThe Economists for Brexit group said the OBR had \"assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the EU, based on bad economic policy-making\".\nAt the end of his speech, Mr Hammond revealed the Autumn Statement would be scrapped in future years, saying there was no need for major tax changes to be made twice a year.\nInstead, he added to laughter from MPs, there would be a \"Spring Statement\" where the government would respond to OBR forecasts, and the Budget would take place in the Autumn. It is not clear whether that means there will be two Budgets in 2017.\nLaura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\nOuch!\nThere was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than Â£100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly Â£60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going.\nRemember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession.\nBut what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications.\nRead more from Laura\nThe government had already announced an extra Â£2bn a year for science by 2020, a crackdown on compensation claims for whiplash injuries aimed at reducing motorists' insurance premiums and Â£1.3bn to improve roads.\nChanges to Universal Credit - the flagship single payment being rolled out across the UK - will reduce the \"taper rate\" from 65% to 63%. This means benefits will be withdrawn at a rate of 63p for every pound of net earnings.\nThe government said about three million households would benefit.\nBut the Resolution Foundation think-tank said their gains would be \"small fry\" compared with previously announced cuts to the work allowance, which is the amount people can earn before they start to lose their benefits.\nOn housing, the government said it would relax rules on how affordable housing funding could be used.\nIt said banning letting agents' upfront fees would help 4.3 million private rental tenants.\nCitizens Advice welcomed measures on the agents' fees and on workers' wages but said more should be done to help \"just-managing families\".\nLabour, which has been calling for agents' fees to be banned, said: \"Any change of heart is welcome\" but added that the government had \"no plan\" to fix the housing crisis.\nResponding to Mr Hammond in the Commons, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Autumn Statement placed on record the \"abject failure of the last six years\".\nHe condemned the government's approach to austerity and said the people the prime minister promised to protect - those who are \"just about managing\" - had been \"betrayed\".\n\"After all the sacrifices people have made over the past six years, I fear today's statement has laid the foundations for more wasted years,\" he added.\nThe SNP said Mr Hammond had offered little on the \"elephant in the room\" - Brexit - while the Lib Dems said the government would \"hit people in the pocket through their hapless handling of Brexit\".\nBut UKIP said billions were being wasted by the government \"delaying\" the UK's exit from the EU.\nPlaid Cymru said there was little in the statement to help rebuild the Welsh economy and close the wage gap with England.","summary":"The UK economy is \"resilient\" despite forecasts that government finances will be Â£122bn worse off than previously expected by 2020, the chancellor said.","id":"38068358"}

Only one is rated as being good, two others have just come out of special measures, and one requires improvement.\nOf the 20 primary schools, only eight are currently deemed to be good or outstanding.\nTucked away behind streets of neat houses is Meadow Primary School.\nThe building is a little down-at-heel, but it is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and green spaces.\nThe school has chosen to begin a journey that hundreds more schools in England may be forced to follow in the coming years.\nMeadow, rated as requiring improvement, is joining the primary-only academy chain REAch2.\nInto this school has stepped a new head teacher, Nadia Paczuska, who was recruited through a scheme called Future Leaders.\nShe says: \"It's very isolated geographically, there is high unemployment among the parents and the area surrounding the school, it's very difficult to recruit to this area and there's a sense of low expectation of the children.\"\nIn order to have enough teachers for the coming year she has recruited from Canada and Romania, and taken to social media to persuade teachers to relocate from around the UK.\nThe local neighbourhood is mainly white, typical of Lowestoft's long-established communities.\nThe school's standing had slipped, and there were some tense moments between parents and her predecessor, but Nadia says there is a will to change.\n\"Most of the parents I speak to are very conscious it's not good enough, and although it had perhaps become normalised it's certainly not something the community are happy about.\"\nAn appeal to the community to roll up its sleeves has led to volunteers offering to set up and run a library, and join a summer work party re-painting parts of the school.\nOver the holidays, the school will also be running catch-up classes for pupils.\nWhich raises the question of whether it's Nadia's determination to lead a team improving the school that will make as much difference as becoming an academy.\nIt is easy to make a case for intervening in schools that are underperforming.\nBut Lowestoft also shows that simply becoming an academy, free from the management of the local council, is not a guarantee of success.\nMany of the pupils from Meadow Primary will head towards what is now called East Point Academy.\nIt became an academy in 2011, but by 2013 under the management of the troubled AET Academies chain it was in special measures.\nThere were concerns about poor teaching, truancy and bullying.\nIn 2014, just 32% of pupils got at least five GCSEs grade A to C, compared with the national average of 53%.\nNow run by the Inspiration Trust, standards are rising and it was taken out of special measures in March this year.\nKevin Blakey, the principal, recognises he is up against a degree of scepticism from parents, staff and pupils because of the school's recent history.\nHe says: \"It went into special measures as an academy and during that time in special measures it had four principals, and obviously with that comes some instability.\"\nThat is probably an understatement.  So what exactly does he get out of being part of an academy trust?\nAs a new head, Kevin has been given a more experienced mentor, whom he meets each week to review progress and talk through problems.\nAnd he tells me that because the academy chain is concentrated in nearby Norfolk, he is also calling on staff from its other schools, for example to check coursework marking.\nThe older Ofsted reports for the school, which used to be called Kirkley Community High School, are a depressing read.\nThey describe persistently low expectations of the largely white, working class kids attending the school.\nWhich brings us back to the case for intervention.\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan told MPs the power to force underperforming schools to become an academy is about creating opportunities.\n\"We believe in a school-led system where experts have greater freedom but within a strong framework of accountability,\" she said.\n\"That is why we want more schools to benefit from the freedom that academy status brings.\"\nBut just last week, Ofsted warned another academy chain, which has expanded very rapidly, that many of its schools weren't improving quickly enough.\nIn particular, it said, that in schools run by Oasis Community Learning Trust: \"Disadvantaged pupils, particularly boys, make significantly less progress than their peers nationally.\"\nThere are eight Regional Schools Commissioners who are meant to monitor the performance of academies and free schools.\nThey have very few staff and a job that is getting bigger.\nIt will also fall to them to implement the new powers to intervene in schools identified as coasting.\nNone was available to speak to the BBC before the draft regulations setting out the detail of the bill about how this will work.\nThe risk, says Tristram Hunt, shadow education secretary, is that \"underperforming schools will simply pass from one poor provider to another, without the measures required to turn around sub-standard school leadership and classroom teaching.\"\nThe government says the difference is it can intervene more rapidly in a failing academy trust.\nThe question is whether that is rapid enough to make a difference for individual pupils.\nPeople like 18-year-old David Stephenson, whom I met hanging out on the seafront at Lowestoft with friends.\nAcademies are independent, state-funded schools, which receive their funding directly from central government, rather than through a local authority.\nAlthough the day-to-day running of the school remains with the head teacher or principal, they are overseen by individual charitable bodies called academy trusts and may be part of an academy chain.\nThese trusts provide advice, support and expertise.\nThey have more freedom than other state schools over their finances and curriculum, and do not need to follow national pay and conditions for teachers.\nAs of June 2015, there are 4,676 academies open in England. There are hundreds more in the pipeline.\nThe number has grown dramatically under the coalition government, from 203 in May 2010.\nNow over half of all secondary schools in England are academies.\nDavid wants to be a welder and is now trying to gain skills at college.\nBut his school years were at Kirkley Community High in its troubled years, where he got into trouble and ended up in a student support unit.\n\"Basically I wasn't taught for a year and a half until I left that school. I got chucked into GCSEs without knowing anything. I was lucky to scrape out Ds.\"\nDavid is clear what he thinks about how growing up in Lowestoft: \"Pretty let down, because it's not the fact of where you should be that determines how good a school should be.\"\nThis in essence is the argument for intervening in areas like Lowestoft.\nTaking a similar approach in areas where schools have broadly been told they are good will be more controversial.\nNot least because the evidence around the academy model is mixed.\nAs Lowestoft has learnt, it is not a one-way ticket to success.","summary":"It is a familiar formula in many ways.","id":"33308278"}

{"document":"It was feared England would travel to India under a new captain in Alastair Cook, get beaten and suffer badly from the experience.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThose fears were not unfounded. England had previously endured a tough year, with the humbling defeat by Pakistan in the UAE followed by the surrender of top spot in the world rankings at home to South Africa.\nIn many ways, though, both of those experiences have made England stronger.\nThe South Africa defeat came amid the backdrop of the Kevin Pietersen saga - with the batsman dropped and then reinstated over texts sent to the opposition camp - but, I have been told by one of the players, that episode has well and truly been put to bed. Spirit in the camp is now genuinely high - that is not just toeing the party line.\nAnd the lessons from the UAE, when England struggled to deal with quality spin on Asian wickets, look finally to have been learnt.\nWhat makes England's achievement in India all the more impressive is the manner in which these wins have been earned.\n\"The mood must be very buoyant in the England dressing room. They have worked harder than India more than anything. The biggest gulf was probably the seamers, Finn and Anderson, and when your fast bowlers are on top it doesn't half make life easier.\"\nThey have lost three tosses in alien conditions but, after the hammering in Ahmedabad, have inflicted two crushing defeats on India, who rarely lose at home. Before this series, India had played 59 home Test matches this century, losing only nine. Now they have lost two in a row. That speaks volumes for how they have been outplayed by a brilliant England side.\nOf course, I also have to point out that as good as England have been, India have been awful - especially their batting.\nBut after Ahmedabad, a few basic things were rammed home to the England team.\nDeep down, they knew they had a better bowling attack than India, but that was never going to do them any good unless they had runs to play with.\nThe tourists worked out what they had to do - bat long, sell your wicket dearly.\nThe results are plain to see. Cook is in stellar form. Pietersen is transformed. Nick Compton looks at home at the top of the order and Ian Bell batted well on the last day in Kolkata.\nPerhaps batting coach Graham Gooch deserves some of the credit. He is tireless in his work with the players, especially those who want to improve. Often during the third Test he has been in the nets throwing balls at 7.30 in the morning.\n1984-85: India 1-2 England (5 Tests)\n1992-93: India 3-0 England (3 Tests)\n2001-02: India 1-0 England (3 Tests)\n2005-06: India 1-1 England (3 Tests)\n2008-09: India 1-0 England (2 Tests)\nIt's also the tiny, minute details where England have gained the advantage. One lunch time, I looked out of the commentary box to see three players in the nets. On closer inspection, I saw they were Steven Finn, James Anderson and Monty Panesar.\nThat striving for improvement, the attention to detail, is what can make all the difference.\nBefore we get carried away, we should recognise that England could still get caught out on a result wicket in the final Test in Nagpur. However, on a decent pitch, even Rahul Dravid says England would start as favourites, something that would have been unthinkable at the start of the series.\nAnd whatever happens in Nagpur, Cook and his men will be able to look back on this tour as a success. What follow are back-to-back series against a New Zealand team in turmoil, which represents a good opportunity to build momentum before the huge double-Ashes year.\nSuccess against Australia and beyond would make the ups and downs experienced in 2012 seem all the more valuable.\nJonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.\nListen to Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott's analysis of the day's play on the Test Match Special podcast.\nWe are using archive pictures for this Test because several photo agencies, including Getty Images, have been barred from the ground following a dispute with the Board of Control for Cricket in India, while other agencies have withdrawn their photographers in protest.","summary":"The turnaround completed by England to beat India so convincingly in Mumbai and Kolkata after the big defeat in Ahmedabad is truly remarkable.","id":"20656971"}

{"document":"That's the aim of a unique clinical trial in Sweden that aims to intervene in the lives of potential abusers. And it's a trial that raises ethical and legal questions about whether societies can come up with therapies for the most dangerous offenders before they have broken the law.\nThe trial at the Karolinska Institute, one of the world's leading medical universities, will recruit up to 60 potential sex offenders before they have broken the law.\nThe team, led by Dr Christoffer Rahm, will then investigate whether they can use a medicine to reduce the risk of the individual committing child abuse.\n\"Up until now most of the attention has been on how to deal with perpetrators [once detected] by the police or by the authorities, but by this stage children have already been harmed,\" says Dr Rahm.\n\"I want to shift focus and explore methods of preventing child sex abuse from happening in the first place.\"\nDrug treatments for sex offenders, popularly known as chemical castration, aren't new. There are a string of countries where men can have medication imposed upon them to crush their sex drive.\nBut nobody knows whether such treatments can be used to prevent abuse in the first place.\nAnd that's where Dr Rahm's programme, which is seeking crowdfunding support, seeks to come in.\nOver the course of two years, the 60 volunteers will be split into two groups. One will receive a drug that is known to rapidly and dramatically reduce levels of testosterone. The other will receive a placebo. Neither the researcher team nor the volunteers will know who is getting the medicine. This convoluted approach is the gold standard for clinical trials because nobody knows who is taking what until the end, meaning no-one can game the results and conclusions can't be prejudiced by assumptions.\nSo, in theory, the researchers could come closer to establishing which types of offenders genuinely benefit in the long-term from having chemical castration-style drugs as part of therapy.\nSo how exactly are they recruiting these volunteers and how will they measure success?\nHere in the UK, seven prisons give anti-libidinal drugs to paedophiles as part of a wider package designed to address offending.\nBut forensic psychiatrist Professor Donald Grubin of the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, a government consultant, says anyone on the cusp of offending is in a different situation altogether.\n\"The problem has been getting psychiatrists on board to treat [potential offenders],\" he says.\n\"If you go to a GP, they will struggle to find someone to refer you on to.\"\nOne British organisation that offers therapeutic help to \"non-offending\" paedophiles has recently received the backing of Paul Jones whose five-year-old daughter April was murdered by a man who had previously downloaded abuse images.\nIn Sweden, things are different. The Karolinksa Institute operates a national helpline for potential offenders called Preventell. It will introduce volunteers to the clinical trial.\nOnce inside the trial, the treatment group will receive a drug called Degarelix which, says Dr Rahm, leaves 97% of men who receive it with no detectable testosterone within three days.\nAnd that raises two important ethical questions - why shouldn't all the volunteers receive the drug and, even more importantly, what happens if the trial comes across evidence that some men fail to respond and children are being exposed to risks?\nFor those of us in the non-scientific world, it may seem odd to deny someone a drug that could help. But the ethical argument goes that the participants on placebos are in no worse position than before they agreed to take part - they have not committed an offence and, therefore, would not be able to receive treatment in the first place.\nAs for the risk of offending, the research team will look for signs of changes in the minds of their subjects. They will test for lower sexual arousal, less impulsiveness (such as testosterone-fuelled lack of self-control) and they will also measure empathy towards potential victims.\nEach volunteer will undergo brain scans that will document their reactions to computer-generated pictures resembling adults and children in swimming costumes or underwear.\nFinally, Dr Rahm says the research includes carefully-constructed questions to uncover whether any of the men are at risk of abusing children at the outset of and during the trial.\nWhatever the results of this Swedish trial, Professor Grubin says society needs to grasp bigger legal and ethical questions over how to offer prevention without scaring off those who need the help.\n\"The problem is confidentiality,\" he says.\n\"If someone says they want help [by downloading abuse images] and the doctor has to report them to the police, then they are not going to come forward.\"","summary":"Can you stop a paedophile before they've abused a child?","id":"35981490"}

{"document":"Carbon nanotubes have long been known to have electronic properties superior to current silicon-based devices.\nBut difficulties in manipulating them have hampered nanotube-based chips.\nThe experiments, reported in Nature Nanotechnology, show a kind of two-part epoxy approach to individually place the nanotubes at high density.\nThe race is on in the semiconductor chip industry to replace current silicon technology - methods to make smaller and therefore faster devices will soon come up against physical limits on just how small a silicon device can be.\nStudy co-author James Hannon, a materials scientist at IBM, said that there are few realistic successors to silicon's throne.\n\"The problem is you have to put it in to production on a 10- or 15-year time scale, so the kinks have to be worked out in the next few years,\" he said.\n\"If you look at all the possibilities out there, there are very few that have actually produced an electronic device that would outperform silicon - there are exotic things out there but they're all still at the 'PowerPoint stage'.\"\nThough single nanotubes have shown vastly superior speed and energy characteristics in lab demonstrations, the challenge has been in so-called integration - getting billions of them placed onto a chip with the precision the industry now demands.\nCurrent chips are made using lithography, in which large wafers of silicon are layered with other materials of different electronic properties and then devices are simply \"etched\" out using a focused beam of electrons or charged atoms.\nTo address the integration challenge, Dr Hannon and his colleagues came up with a solution - two of them in fact.\nThe first was a chemical that coats nanotubes and makes them soluble in water.\nThe second was a solution that binds to the first chemical and to the element hafnium, but not to silicon.\nThe team used standard techniques to etch a pattern of channels in hafnium deposited on silicon.\nThen they simply \"double-dipped\" the chip into the two solutions - one chemical stuck to the hafnium, and the other chemical acted as the second part of a two-part epoxy, tightly binding nanotubes to the hafnium regions on the chip but not to silicon.\nThe result was a series of neatly aligned nanotube devices, already wired up within the pattern, at a density of a billion per square centimetre.\n\"That's one nanotube every 150 or 200 (billionths of a metre) or so,\" explained Dr Hannon. \"That's not good enough to make a microprocessor yet - it's a factor of 10 away.\n\"But it's a factor of 100 better than has been done previously.\"\nThe demonstration is a \"huge improvement\", but Dr Hannon said several issues are still to be solved.\nThey incude finding more efficient ways to sort through nanotubes - which are made in a wide variety of sizes and types - to select in large quantity and high accuracy the kind suitable for devices.\nThe etching process that sets the ultimate size of a transistor on the chip must also be improved.\nFor now, the team has modelled what it can do with the technique in its current form - a vast array of transistors, each comprising six nanotubes spaced 10 nanometres apart.\nTheir models suggest a 10-fold jump in performance - a chip run at more than three times the frequency and consuming just a third the energy.\nHowever, in the longer term, nanotube chips would run up against the same limits that silicon faces; as Dr Hannon puts it, \"we're limited by the size of an atom eventually\".\n\"But this at least gives us a way to gain performance while shrinking the device.\"","summary":"Scientists have demonstrated methods that could see higher-performance computer chips made from tiny straws of carbon called nanotubes.","id":"20086402"}

{"document":"The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May says there is no turning back from the triggering of Article 50, which starts the process of leaving the EU.\nReality Check verdict: The government is clear that it respects the result of the referendum, so it argues that any debate is theoretical. However, the question of whether Article 50 is irrevocable is the subject of legal dispute.\nAs a result, the UK government has been unable to make any definitive legal statements on the issue.\nThe Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has said \"My understanding is that it is irrevocable,\" while the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said in December 2016: \"Is it irrevocable? I don't know.\"\nIn the recent UK Supreme Court case on Article 50, both sides assumed that it was irrevocable and the court judgement concluded: \"We are content to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own.\"\nSo this is not an issue that has been formally tested in a UK court.\nBut European Council President Donald Tusk has said that he believes Article 50 can be reversed.\nWhen asked if the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification during the next two years, he said, \"Formally, legally, yes.\"\nLord Kerr - the former British ambassador to the EU, who helped draft Article 50 - agreed.\n\"You can change your mind while the process is going on,\" he said.\nHe acknowledged that this might annoy the rest of the EU, and be seen as a huge waste of time.\n\"They might try to extract a political price,\" Lord Kerr said, \"but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.\"\nThe distinction between political and legal opinion on this issue is critical. The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind.\nBut who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question?\nArticle 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice.\nThere is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer.\nOne other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU.\nBut Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed.\nNo-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility.\nThe argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court.\nThe rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.\nRead more from Reality Check","summary":"Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was written with a deliberate lack of clarity - it does not say whether it can be revoked once it has been triggered.","id":"39291512"}

So far no trace of it has been found.\nSearch efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth.\nDid previous photos show plane debris?\nUsing satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane.\nJohn Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had \"moved on\" from that area based on the new information.\nActing Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south.\n\"Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,\" Mr Hussein said.\nA statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia.\nThis was based on \"continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost\", Amsa said.\n\"It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean.\"\nIt said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) had determined that this was \"the most credible lead to where debris may be located\".\nThe new search area is about 1,850km west of Perth and covers some 319,000 sq km (123,000 sq miles).\nMr Young, of Amsa, said it represented the \"best estimate of the area in which the aircraft is likely to have entered the ocean\" and took account of possible drift.\nThe new search area was outside the \"roaring forties\" bad weather zone, meaning conditions were likely to be better. Aircraft would also be able to spend more time in the area because it was closer to land, Mr Young said.\nThe potential flight path could be the subject of further refinement as investigations continued, Amsa said, adding that satellites would now focus on the new area.\nAmsa said nine military aircraft would be scouring the area on Friday, with a civilian aircraft acting as a communications relay.\nWhat we know\nThe search for flight MH370\nFive ships from China and one from Australia were also relocating to that area.

But more than two-thirds of cabinet posts are still unfilled.\nThe decision by President Ghani to suspend all provincial governors and police chiefs has led to the further stagnation of government across the country.\nThe reformist governor of Nangarhar province in the east has resigned from the post because he was left without the power he needed to do his job.\nNangarhar is in a crucial location, both in terms of security as well as revenue-raising, as it is the gateway to Afghanistan from the Khyber Pass in the east.\nIts provincial capital, Jalalabad, has been facing increasing attacks from the Taliban and other insurgents in recent months.\nAt a public meeting, a number of elders signed a letter urging the governor, Mullah Ata Ullah Ludin, not to stand down. One said that he was the only person taking on the \"criminal mafia\".\nMr Ludin's departure leaves this important province leaderless. He finally insisted he had to step down because he could not make the decisions he wanted.\nHis \"acting\" status meant he was prevented from appointing new teachers, and an order he gave to close a border weighing station was overturned.\nHe had made the decision because trucks were constantly leaving far heavier than had been weighed - and must have paid a bribe for the difference.\nApart from the lost revenues, the heavy trucks were damaging the region's roads.  He said that if the situation of acting governors and police chiefs was not resolved soon, then the country would \"slide towards instability; people will lose faith in the government and corruption will increase\".\nIt's the same story in the province of Herat, the gateway to Iran, at the western end of Afghanistan's most important trade route.\nStagnation here following the suspension from office of most senior officials has provoked the former governor Ismail Khan to actively campaign against President Ghani's government.\nKhan was a prominent commander in the jihadi war against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. He and other ex-jihadi commanders say they are locked out of government, and are a formidable opposition to the technocratic moderniser who is now president.\nBut President Ghani is also losing support among those who previously backed him.\nMPs like Helai Ershad say that far from establishing a reformist government, he has had to make alliances with men she described as \"a bunch of mujahidin\".\nShe said that the problems began when the international community persuaded Ghani to share power with Abdullah Abdullah, the opponent he narrowly defeated in a contested election.\nSince both men have two deputies, there are six separate powerbases to satisfy in making appointments.\n\"Two different mentalities, how can they work under the same umbrella?,\" she asked.\nSince there are no political parties in Afghanistan, a country where patronage is the main driver of power, the jockeying for position has gone on.\nMs Ershad believes that only 10 of the more than 20 ministers still to be confirmed by parliament will be approved this time round.\nAnd the issue of appointing substantive provincial governors and police chiefs has still to be addressed.","summary":"Afghanistan still does not have a full government a year after the presidential election.","id":"32196037"}

We want to ensure the business rates system is fair, efficient and effective,\" said Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury.\nThe Treasury said the review will look at how firms use property, what the UK could learn from other countries and how the system could be modernised to better reflect changes in property values.\n\"Lots and lots of people have views about how the business rates system doesn't work, but as soon as you get into what an alternative system might look like there's much less consensus,\" Mr Alexander added, speaking to the BBC's Wake up to Money programme.\nLabour's shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury Shabana Mahmood said: \"Britain's businesses need more than just a re-announced review. Labour will take immediate action by cutting and then freezing business rates for 1.5 million small business properties.\"\nThe announcement follows widespread criticism of the current system, where rates are charged to retailers based on the value of their shop or other commercial property.\nThe arrangement means that companies with similar turnovers can pay dramatically different sums for business rates because their properties have varying \"rateable values\" depending on the size and location of their premises.\nJohn Cridland, director-general of the CBI, said the current system of business rates was \"outmoded, clunky and regressive\" and \"holding back the high street\".\n\"We'll be making the case for removing the smallest firms from paying business rates completely... and introducing more frequent valuations,\" he said.\nJohn Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the review, but said \"actions speak louder than words\".\n\"Unless a root and branch reform of business rates is delivered at Budget 2016, firms will regard this as a missed opportunity to tackle a huge brake on investment and growth,\" he added.\nThe rates paid by English businesses are the highest of any European Union country and can be a company's biggest expense after wages and rent.\nRates have been blamed for the decline of many High Streets and the rising number of vacant shops.\nBusiness rates are calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses. They date back to the Poor Law established in 1601.\nCurrent valuations are still based on property prices in 2008, before the economic downturn hit the value of commercial real estate, as the government postponed a revaluation scheduled for last year.","summary":"A \"radical\" review of the business rates system in England has been launched, with its findings due in time for the Budget in 2016.","id":"31897113"}

{"document":"Lady Butler-Sloss has been under pressure to quit from MPs and victims concerned about her family links.\nHer late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s.\nHome Secretary Theresa May said she did not regret appointing the peer, adding that she would \"not hang around\" in naming her successor.\nLady Butler-Sloss said she \"did not sufficiently consider\" whether her family links would cause difficulties in the inquiry.\nDowning Street said it would \"take a few days\" to appoint a new chairman and appeared to indicate that whoever was chosen would not be so closely linked to the establishment.\nMrs May told MPs that she believed Lady Butler-Sloss was the \"right person for the job\" despite what she suggested was a lot of \"rumour and innuendo\" about her appointment.\n\"I do not regret the decision I made. I continue to believe that Elizabeth Butler-Sloss would have done an excellent job as chair of this inquiry,\" she told the Home Affairs select committee.\nAsked about her successor, Mrs May said she still favoured appointing a single individual to head the over-arching inquiry rather than a panel of experts urged by Labour and some abuse victims.\nShe said she hoped to name a new candidate \"within a reasonable amount of time\" but said whoever was approached would need to \"think carefully\" about the nature of the role.\nKeith Vaz, chairman of the committee, which is also investigating historical child sex abuse, said the handling of the issue had been \"somewhat shambolic\" and raised issues about Mrs May's judgement.\nIn a statement, Lady Butler-Sloss said she had been \"honoured\" to be asked to chair the inquiry and had hoped to \"make a useful contribution\".\nBut, she added: \"It has become apparent over the last few days, however, that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry.\n\"It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties.\n\"This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government.\n\"Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the Home Secretary.\"\nThe inquiry was set up to examine how state institutions handled their duty of care to protect children from paedophiles.\nWhat next? By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson\nMost public bodies at least claim they appoint people because of what they know, not who they know. But it was Lady Butler-Sloss's family and political connections - not her experience and knowledge - which led to her resignation.\nThere will be no rush to appoint her successor - it could take several days. That's because while her resignation was unfortunate, a second controversial appointment might look like carelessness at the top of government.\nAlready there are calls for a figure less linked to the establishment to be appointed - but if a legal background, along with the security clearance to read confidential government papers is required, then that could be easier said than done.\nDavid Cameron's spokesman said Lady Butler-Sloss's decision to quit was \"entirely\" her own.\n\"The reasons for her appointment still absolutely stand in terms of her professional expertise and her integrity, which I don't think has been questioned from any quarter whatsoever, and rightly so,\" he said.\nAppearing before the Commons home affairs select committee, Mrs May was asked whether she was aware before appointing Lady Butler-Sloss of claims that her late brother had tried to persuade former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens against naming an alleged paedophile on the floor of the House of Commons.\nMrs May implied the answer to that question was no, saying that these were issues which had \"surfaced in the last few days as far as I am concerned\".\nShe added: \"There was absolutely no doubt that Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was Michael Havers' sister. That was well known. A number of issues about Michael Havers had been raised publicly in the past.\"\nShe insisted she had conducted \"due diligence\" on Lady Butler-Sloss before appointing her, including holding a \"number of discussions\" with relevant people, but said the focus was on her ability to perform the role.\n\"My judgement was about her integrity to do this job. That is why I appointed her.\"\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was the right decision since concerns about \"victim confidence or conflict of interest\" had not been addressed.\n\"It is very unfortunate that the last minute nature of the Home Secretary's response means that proper consideration was not given to the perception of conflict of interest and Lady Butler-Sloss was placed in an unfair position by the Home Office,\" she said.\nAuthor Alex Wheatle, who was abused at a children's home in the late 1960s, said victims must be \"100% sure they will be treated fairly\".\n\"For any people coming forward they must have the utmost confidence in whoever chairs that inquiry,\" he said.\nPeter Saunders, from the National Association for Abused People in Childhood, said the government had \"missed a trick\" in not seeking the views of victims before the appointment.\n\"We need somebody who is trusted,\" he said. \"This is not a slight on Lady Butler-Sloss... but there were so many things stacked against her in having the trust of survivors.\"","summary":"Retired judge Baroness Butler-Sloss has stepped down as head of a probe into child sex abuse saying she was \"not the right person\" for the job.","id":"28295282"}

Nationally, 14% of pupils are in this category.\nEven the chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association, Robert McCartney, says: \"They will have to introduce some conditions that will prevent these schools being swamped by families with money.\"\nHence the new requirement for any new selective school\/grammar to take a proportion of disadvantaged pupils, establish a \"high quality, non-selective free school\", set up or sponsor a primary feeder school in a deprived area or sponsor an underperforming academy.\nGrammar school heads have been talking to the Department for Education for some years about the ways in which they might do this.\nOf the 163 grammar schools in England, more than 70 are planning to give some form of priority to disadvantaged pupils from next year, says Jim Skinner of the Grammar School Heads Association.\nThis year, it is about 30 schools.\nThis is most likely to be through a quota system based on recent new rules allowing schools to give priority in admissions to children on the pupil premium.\nThe Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham, a chain of five schools, has led the way, having just admitted its second cohort of pupils with a quota for children on the pupil premium.\nIn this case, they have lowered the test requirements for disadvantaged pupils.\nThis may be the way it goes in some areas with a patchwork system of selective and non-selective schools.\nBut as the law stands this method will serve only the very poorest of families.\nFor it to go further and include a broader range of low-income families, another change in the admissions code will be required.\nHowever, in areas where the local authority administers the 11-plus test, the council could decide to prioritise low-income children, potentially by broadening the ability range that might secure a grammar place.\nAreas such as these are sending between 20% and 25% of their most able children to grammar schools.\nCurrently, there is also a system of head teacher review in some selective counties.\nThis is where primary school head teachers put forward a number of disadvantaged children who may not have done well enough in the test, but who they feel show promise.\nThe prime minister's plans look set to formalise steps which are already under way in some grammar schools, and indeed the wider education system.\nIt is not yet clear how a poor but bright pupil quota system would work, but it is clear from existing examples that there may be a need to lower the pass mark for entrance tests for those from poor backgrounds.\nThis is because as they tend to have had less of the advantages in early life they are likely to fall behind wealthier peers.\nThey are also unlikely to have received the same kind of intensive tutoring for the 11-plus that wealthier children have received.\nSo we could see the same kind of system that some universities use to ensure brighter students from poorer backgrounds with academic potential are not shut out.\nHigh-performing schools converting to academy status are already required to work in partnership with struggling schools, and many head teachers do this voluntarily.\nBut proposals for new or expanding grammars to establish or sponsor a non-selective academy or free schools may tie selective schools into the wider system in a way they have not been previously.\nThe 1950s were without doubt the halcyon days of the grammar school system, with bright children from poorer backgrounds fast-tracked into schools thought suitable for their academic ability.\nPupils who passed the 11-plus exam were destined for university and better jobs, while those who failed went to secondary modern schools and trod a path towards less celebrated professions.\nThe system covered the whole of England until the mid-1960s, when the Labour government ordered local education authorities to start phasing out grammar schools and secondary moderns.\nThey replaced them with a comprehensive system - where children of all abilities were to be taught together in the same schools.\nThis phasing-out happened at different paces, and a handful of local authorities decided to keep largely selective systems.\nIn 1998, Labour ruled out the creation of any new grammar schools, and limited any expansion in selection within other types of schools.\nThe reach and extent of grammar schools today is very patchy - a legacy from the different responses to the call for comprehensive education and the fact that many grammars converted to independent schools.\nIn total in England there are 163 grammar schools today - but more than two-thirds of England's 150 local authorities have none at all.\nAnd the areas that do have at least some grammar schools tend to be in more affluent parts of the south of England.\nAreas such as Kent, Medway, Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire have selective systems where the 11-plus test is usually administered by the local authority.\nChildren either pass the test and get into a grammar or they do not.\nBut areas such as Gloucestershire, Trafford and Slough have a mix of selective and non-selective secondary schools.\nSome London boroughs have one or two grammar schools, where the 11-plus test is administered by the school itself.\nGetting a grammar school place in these areas is particularly competitive, but overall there are between 10 and 15 applications per grammar school place, according to the Grammar School Association.\nIn effect, what many schools do is skim off the most high-achieving pupils who sit the test. So if 1,500 youngsters sit the exam, those with the top 150 marks will get in.\nSome say the current ban on opening new grammar schools has led to selection on merit being replaced with selection on financial grounds, because middle-class parents can pay for intensive tutoring for the 11-plus.\nGrammar schools in these mixed areas sit alongside many more different school types than in the past.\nNot only are there \"bog-standard\" comprehensives - now known as community schools - but academies and schools with specialist subjects that are allowed to select a small percentage of pupils by their aptitude for that subject.\nAnd there are free schools, which cannot select by ability, but can promote an ethos more like a traditional grammar school if they wish.\nFollowing the 1998 ban on the creation of new grammar schools, many of the remaining grammars, responding to demand, have expanded their numbers.\nBetween 2002 and 2008, the number of grammar school places grew by 30,000 - the equivalent of 30 new schools.\nThen, in late 2015, the then Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, gave permission for the Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge Wells to open an \"annexe\" on a site several miles away in Sevenoaks.\nThis was seen by many commentators as setting a precedent and paving the way for a new wave of grammar schools.\nSince then, no others have expanded on to satellite sites, but there are a number of schools, including one in Theresa May's constituency, that wish to do so.\nAlthough the prime minister has ruled out a wholesale return to a \"binary system\", there is no doubt that an expansion of selective schooling is on the cards.","summary":"As the prime minister sets out plans for a new wave of grammars and selective schools, we ask how they might look.","id":"37305812"}

There would have to be negotiations between the UK and the WTO's 161 members.\nCatherine Barnard, professor of European Law at Cambridge University, says that without an agreement in those two years \"we fall out of the EU, in probably a rather disorderly fashion\".\nShe points to the sheer number of issues that would need addressing.\n\"Think of European migrants living here,\" she says.\n\"What will be their rights going forward?\"\nBut nothing here is straightforward.\nSome in the Leave camp want to avoid Article 50 altogether; they would prefer to engage in inter-governmental negotiations.\nThey do not want to be locked into a timetable.\nIt is also uncertain how other European leaders and officials would respond to this.\nTheir big fear is contagion; that other countries could follow the UK example.\nSo, they could be inclined to make the UK sweat.\nAs the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker said: \"Deserters would not be treated kindly.\"\nHowever, there would be strong pressure from Europe's businesses to deal with the UK swiftly and perhaps enter into a transitional agreement.\nSo, it is unclear what tactics the government would employ and how soon talks would begin.\nThe Leave campaign has promised to leave the EU by the next election - in May 2020.\nSome in the Leave campaign want to move much more quickly and repeal the European Communities Act that establishes the supremacy of EU law.\nThere might be, however, legal challenges to such a move, and other European countries could be fiercely resistant to the UK unpicking EU laws before a withdrawal agreement has been concluded.\nThere is likely to be a twin-track process, with one agreement to leave and another to govern future trade.\nDuring the campaign, it has not been established which trade model, if any, the Leave camp favours.\nSome have proposed exiting the single market, because the price of staying would be accepting rules such as freedom of movement.\nThey are in favour of striking a UK-EU free trade deal.\nBut how long would that take?\nAnd, then, further down the road, there would be the sifting of EU directives to determine which should be kept and which ones dropped.\nThen, there is the politics.\nThree-quarters of MPs support EU membership, and yet they would have to vote to repeal legislative ties with Brussels.\nProf Damian Chalmers, from the London School of Economics, says it is unclear \"what we would be negotiating aboutÃ¢â¬Â¦ what is the clear British interest\".\nPeople, he says, want different things and the sifting process would not be done in this Parliament or the next.\nAnd once a deal - both for withdrawing and for trade - had been concluded with Brussels, would that need to be put to the people again?\nThere are many denials, but Europe has a history of second referendums.\nBoris Johnson has said: \"Out is outÃ¢â¬Â¦ get out, and, then, negotiate a series of trade arrangements around the world.\"\nSo what would \"out\" look like?\nNo-one really knows.\nOnly Greenland has left, and that was 30 years ago.\nAnd what if the vote is very close?\nSay the difference is just 30,000 votes.\nHow final would that be?\nWould it have settled the argument for a generation or would there be gridlock at Westminster as each piece of legislation is argued over?\n\"What happens after?\" is just one of the complicated questions voters have been struggling with amid the noise of campaigning.","summary":"This week's referendum has been billed as a historic moment; a cross on the paper sketching out the country's future identity and its place in the world.","id":"36573959"}

{"document":"Genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes, expired vaccines and more recently, the use of larvicide to stop mosquitoes from breeding, have all been blamed.\nPosts on social media expressing these theories have been widely shared - although rarely by respected scientists.\nAnd Brazil's health authorities have been caught off guard, describing the frenzy as a \"real information war\" with a \"complex scenario of actors, interests and worldviews\".\nWhat you need to know\nTravel advice\nWould it be wrong to eradicate mosquitoes?\nNow they are pushing back, which experts say is a \"key part\" of managing any outbreak.\n\"This happens everywhere each time there is an epidemic of some sort\", says Professor Jimmy Whitworth from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\"At the moment, there is nothing in any of the rumours about insecticides, larvicides, vaccines and GM mosquitoes that seems at all persuasive. The spatial and temporal fit is poor between cases of microcephaly and the use of any of these technologies.\"\nBut the Brazilian authorities were unable to prevent a rumour pointing the finger at the larvicide pyriproxyfen from gaining traction online.\nThe theory grew in popularity after doctors from the Argentine group Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Villages, which campaigns against GM crops and the use of pesticides, published a report linking the larvicide with microcephaly.\nThe report said the product was first introduced in Brazil's northeast in 2014, a year before the increase in microcephaly, and also claimed the Brazilian Association of Public Health (Abrasco) was aware of this link.\nThe Argentine group argued that Zika has not caused birth defects in other countries and says there are no records of microcephaly in the current Zika epidemic in Colombia.\nThis ignores an increase in microcephaly in French Polynesia after a Zika surge between 2013 and 2014 and also overlooks the fact that the epidemic in Colombia is still recent. Although more than 3,000 pregnant women there have been infected by Zika, only a few of them have given birth.\nBut the Brazilian government was on the back foot.\nAbrasco was forced to deny it had linked pesticides, larvicides or any other chemical products to the rise in microcephaly.\nMeanwhile Brazil's Ministry of Health attempted to reassure people by saying pyriproxyfen had been approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as well as Brazil's health surveillance agency Anvisa.\nEven so, two Brazilian states - Rio Grande do Sul in the south and Para in the north - temporarily banned its use in drinking water, saying they wanted to avoid any risks while further studies were carried out.\nBut in the worst-affected state, Pernambuco, the facts do not support the larvicide theory.\nSome areas where pyriproxyfen is used do not have any cases of microcephaly while the city of Recife, which has most cases, does not use it, officials at the state's centre for disease control said.\nAnd doctors say the alterations seen in the babies' CT scans suggest that the lesions were caused by a congenital infection, and not by pesticides, drugs or vaccines.\nBut researchers are looking for a \"third factor\" involved in causing microcephaly in addition to the Zika virus.\nCarlos Brito, a researcher with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Pernambuco, says most pregnant women who have Zika have normal babies.\n\"We need to know: does it depend on the stage of pregnancy when the mother is infected? Does it have to do with their immune system? Might there be socioeconomic factors as well, maybe the state of nutrition of the mothers?\" he said.\nBut as the wait for answers continues, the rumours multiply.\n\"They raise an uproar.

{"document":"Over the years, the 17th Century monument has been threatened by pollution, unabashed construction, a crematorium and even bombs.\nThe BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi reports on five threats - past and present - to India's \"monument of love\".\nAn invasion of the insect called Chironomus Calligraphus (Geoldichironomus) is turning the Taj Mahal green, says environmental activist DK Joshi.\nMr Joshi has filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal - a special tribunal set up by the government to deal with environmental disputes - saying that the \"explosive breeding\" of the pests in the polluted Yamuna river is marring the beauty of the monument.\n\"Fifty-two drains are pouring waste directly into the river and just behind the monument, Yamuna has become so stagnant that fish that earlier kept insect populations in check are dying. This allows pests to proliferate in the river,\" Mr Joshi told the BBC by phone from the northern city of Agra where the Taj is located.\nThe stains the bugs leave on the marble are washable and workers from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have been trying to scrub the walls clean, but Mr Joshi says frequent scrubbing can take the sheen off the marble.\nHe says the problem has a simple solution - just clean up the Yamuna.\nOn Monday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav ordered officials to \"trace the factors behind the problem and find a solution\".\nBuilt by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth, Taj Mahal is often described as one of the wonders of the world.\nIt is also India's biggest tourist attraction, visited by heads of states, celebrities and millions of Indian and foreign tourists every year.\nBut pollution from the industries in Agra and a nearby oil refinery have seen the white marble yellowing over the years.\nTo restore the monument's beauty, the ASI has been applying \"mud packs\" on its walls to draw out the pollutants.\nManoj Bhatnagar of the ASI's chemical department told the BBC that the mud-pack is based on a traditional recipe used by Indian women from ancient times to restore a natural glow to their faces.\n\"A layer of fullers earth - a type of lime-rich clay - mixed with water is applied over the walls and left on for 24 hours or more to dry,\" he said.\n\"Once it dries, the mud is removed and the surface is washed with distilled water to remove impurities.\"\nThe marble mausoleum had been given this treatment several times in the past: in 1994, 2001, 2008 and 2014.\nMr Bhatnagar said the next round of beauty treatment will begin once the weather cools a bit - the heat wave currently blowing across India will dry out the mud-pack too quickly and render it ineffective.\nIn November 2002, the government of the Uttar Pradesh state began work on a shopping complex near the Taj Mahal.\nThe state government, led by then chief minister Mayawati, said the mall was being constructed to relocate shops that had been removed from the Taj Mahal under a Supreme Court order.\nThe authorities said that once the mall opened, tourists would be able to visit the Taj without having to go through the crowded and polluted streets.\nHowever, the project prompted howls of protest from environmentalists who said the project violated environment protection laws and placed the monument at risk.\nThe proposal was eventually abandoned.\nLast year, India's Supreme Court ordered a wood-burning crematorium near the Taj Mahal to be moved to protect the monument from the smoke and ash blown over from funeral pyres.\nThe court said the authorities could either move the 200-year-old crematorium or build an electric powered one to reduce pollution to the monument.\nThe state government agreed, but faced protests from some Hindu groups. So far, the crematorium still has not been moved.\nSecurity at the Taj Mahal was tightened last year after reports that al-Qaeda had threatened to attack the monument.\nThis was not the first time the Taj had been on the radar of militant groups - in January 2001, security was stepped up after reports that Pakistan-based militant group Laskhar-e-Taiba was threatening to blow up the monument.\nPolice said they were investigating an e-mail from the group threatening to attack the Taj, but a spokesman for LeT denied the allegation, saying it was Indian propaganda to discredit them.","summary":"India's iconic Taj Mahal has been threatened in recent weeks by insect poo - environmentalists say that bugs from the polluted Yamuna river nearby are invading the monument, leaving greenish-black patches of waste on its pristine white marble walls.","id":"36366733"}

{"document":"That is the warning in a report from economists at the World Bank.\nBut there are some more upbeat aspects of their assessment. They don't reject the idea that this might just be a temporary soft patch.\nAnd they say emerging economies are not as vulnerable as they were in previous decades.\nThe starting point for this report is the marked slowdown in growth that has already taken place in the emerging market economies since 2010.\nThey have grown more slowly than the five years before the international financial crisis. By last year, the growth rate had slipped below the long-term average.\nChina is the most high-profile example and in a way it's a special case. A slowdown there was seen as inevitable after three decade of rapid economic expansion.\nBut many others in this group have also seen their performance weaken including Brazil, Russia and South Africa. (India is something of an exception.)\nTheir slowdown contrasts with a weak but steady recovery in the advanced economies.\nThe central question posed by the report is whether this is a temporary problem or the beginning of a new era of slower growth.\nThere is no definitive answer in this report, but there is a clear sense of unease that it might be the latter, less attractive of the two possibilities.\nSome of the factors behind the slowdown are likely to be persistent. Many are affected by sliding prices of commodities such as metals and oil. There has also been weaker demand in export markets for their products, which in turn partly reflects what the report calls \"anaemic growth in the advanced economies\".\nInternational trade is likely to stay weak as the rich countries' recovery remains hesitant. Large investments in commodity production in recent years are likely to mean strong supplies which will keep downward pressure on prices.\nSome, especially oil exporters, have seen a deterioration in government finances as tax revenue has fallen sharply.\nThere also been a marked decline in foreign investment going into emerging economies. It fell by about a quarter between 2010 and 2014. In the first part of 2015 there was a marked increase in capital leaving the emerging economies.\nThere are also domestic factors, including aging populations in many emerging economies.  The growth in productivity - the amount that each worker produces - has slowed in many.\nThe report describes the slowdown as \"unusually synchronous (affecting many countries at the same time) and protracted\".\nLooking, ahead the report notes the prospect of higher borrowing costs as the US Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates - widely expected to begin as soon as next week.\nThat is likely to lead also to a stronger dollar. That makes money borrowed in dollars more expensive to repay and the amount of foreign currency debt has increased from 30% of emerging economies' national income in 2007 to 36% last year.\nDeclining currencies could also cause an inflation problem - they make imports more costly.\nThere are clearly some reasons to be concerned. But the World Bank's economists also emphasise how these countries have changed compared with the 1980s and 90s.\nThey have reduced debt and inflation levels, diversified their economies (they are less dependent on specific industries and so less in danger if those industries get into difficulty). And they have improved their economic policies.\nWhat should they do? There is no one-size-fits-all. Those who can afford to spend more on infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, energy) would benefit from doing so.\nThere's a call for continued efforts to improve the climate for business, make labour markets more effective, tackle corruption and improve the efficiency of government.  Much of this is frankly advice the Bank would give to most countries most of the time.\nSo no hard conclusions here.  More of a warning; a call for economic vigilance.","summary":"The emerging market countries are at a crossroads, facing the possibility of new era of slower economic growth.","id":"35046944"}

The sailing of a US ship within those limits indicates the US does not recognise those territorial claims.\nBeijing said it would use \"all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and security\".\nIt also accused the US of \"deliberately stirring up troubles\" in the region as China and South East Asian neighbours have \"cooled down and improved the situation\".\nThe tiny island is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. China has been embroiled in maritime disputes with several of its regional neighbours in recent years.\nThe US conducts a programme called \"freedom of navigation\" which challenges \"excessive claims\" to the world's oceans and airspace.\nIt was developed to ensure all countries adhere to UN maritime rules.\nThe US State Department says the programme operates through diplomacy, \"operational assertions\" by the US military, and consultations with other governments.\nThe military operation is the second since Mr Trump took office. In May, the USS Dewey sailed less than 12 nautical miles from an artificial island built by China called Mischief Reef, which is part of the Spratly Islands.\nUS Defence Secretary James Mattis said a few days later that the US would not accept China's militarisation of man-made islands in the region.\nIn previous years, the US has conducted such operations against China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\nRival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years as Beijing has begun re-asserting its claims.\nThe area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves.\nThe various islands and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.\nMuch of the conflict has been centred on two clusters of islands, the Paracels and Spratlys.\nChina claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries, and issued a map in 1947 detailing its claims.\nUnder President Xi Jinping, China has ramped up its territorial assertions, building artificial islands and military facilities on reefs while also carrying out naval patrols in disputed waters.\nBut China denies the accusations of militarisation, saying the facilities are for civilian and defence purposes.","summary":"Beijing has called the presence of a US warship near a disputed island in the South China Sea \"a serious political and military provocation\".","id":"40476521"}

It said the figure was \"extraordinary\".\nMany of the filings were for innovations in telecoms, computing, semiconductors and medical tech.\nBeijing had urged companies to boost the number of such applications.\nBut some experts have cast doubt as to whether it signifies that the country is truly more inventive than others, since most of China's filings were done locally.\nA patent is the monopoly property right granted by a government to the owner of an invention.\nThis allows the creator and subsequent owners to prevent others from making, using, offering for sale or importing their invention into the country for a limited time.\nIn return they must agree for the patent filing to be publicly disclosed.\nRead our guide to the world's patent system\nA total of 2.9 million patent applications were filed worldwide in 2015, according to Wipo, marking a 7.8% rise on the previous year.\nChina can lay claim to driving most of that growth. Its domestic patent office - the Property Office of the People's Republic of China (Sipo)  - received a record 1,101,864 filings.\nThat was more than its Japanese, South Korean and US equivalents combined.\nBut Chinese inventors were more reticent about seeking patent rights abroad.\nAccording to Wipo, they filed just 42,154 applications outside their borders - Huawei and ZTE, two smartphone and telecoms equipment-makers, led the way.\nBy comparison US-based inventors sought more than five times that figure. And Japan, Germany and France also outnumbered the Asian giant.\nOne patent expert, who works with Chinese firms but asked not to be named, said the disparity in the figures was telling.\n\"What's called a patent in China is often a species of design, and these are the things they are getting copious amounts of,\" he said.\n\"This is probably innovation at its thinnest.

{"document":"Many researchers thought ministers would sit on this controversial issue. Instead, the chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has announced that draft regulations will be published within months.\nShe predicts that couples affected by mitochondrial disease could benefit from the treatment within two years, enabling them to have healthy children.\nSo why is this such a significant moment?\nFirstly the UK will become the first country to allow the technique, aimed at preventing a range of potentially deadly genetic disorders.\nThis will underline Britain's pioneering role in genetics and IVF stretching back to both the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 and the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, in 1978.\nSecondly, the technique itself will result in babies with DNA from three people - two women and a man - and this genetic alteration will be passed down the generations.\nOnce babies have been born using this technique, there will be no going back. A permanent and novel genetic change to members of the human race will have been made.\nThat might sound pretty worrying, and talk of three people's DNA mixed together seems a bit ghoulish at first glance.  So is this science overstepping the mark?\nA public consultation conducted by the fertility regulator, the HFEA, found there was broad support for the technique, once the details had been explained.\nSo let's look briefly at the science.\nMitochondria are the energy factories of cells. They contain a tiny bit of DNA and just 37 genes, sitting outside the nucleus which has more than 20,000 genes - including all the crucial genetic material from both parents.\nMitochondrial disorders are always passed down the maternal line in the egg, so the technique being pioneered by Prof Doug Turnbull and his team at Newcastle University involves using healthy donor eggs.\nPut briefly, conventional IVF is performed and then, after fertilisation, the pro-nuclei of the father and mother - you can see them clearly as the two round balls inside the glass tube in the picture above - are sucked out of the developing embryo.\nThis leaves behind the faulty mitochondria. The parents' genetic material is then injected into a healthy donor egg which has had its pro-nuclei removed but still has healthy mitochondria.\nThe scientists believe the resulting embryo should develop normally. It means all the crucial parental genes will be retained, plus a tiny amount of DNA from the female donor.\nSo how much DNA from the second woman is there? There is 1.05 metres of DNA in the nucleus and 0.0054 mm of DNA in our mitochondria.\nLet's put that another way.  If you imagine the DNA in your nucleus - remember this is all the important stuff which makes us what we are - and stretched it from Trafalgar Square to Prof Turnbull's laboratory in Newcastle, you'd have a double helix of 282 miles.\nNow if you laid all the DNA from the mitochondria alongside it, it would stretch from Trafalgar Square, barely round the corner to the National Portrait Gallery - just a couple of hundred yards.  That perhaps gives you an idea of just how little DNA is involved.\nThe scientists in Newcastle say their technique is akin to changing the battery of a laptop computer. The hard-drive - containing all the important information - is the parental DNA in the nucleus which remains unchanged. The battery is simply the power source.\nAnimal research and a number of scientific reviews suggest the technique is safe. But the Newcastle team reckon they have another year or more research to do before they will be completely satisfied.\nOne limiting factor for the researchers is the shortage of healthy donor eggs. They need women in the Newcastle area who are prepared to altruistically donate their eggs.\nAnother team in Oregon is using a similar technique and is discussing future research with the American regulators.\nThe next step here will be the publication of draft regulations.\nThere will be a debate and a free vote in parliament. A final scientific review of safety will be made and then assuming all hurdles have been passed, it will be open to the Newcastle team to apply for a licence from the HFEA. Each case, each couple being treated, will require a separate licence.\nBut before then, further public debate is being actively encouraged - this is an occasion where science, ethics and regulation seem to be proceeding at the same pace.\nThere will be some who find this disturbing - tampering with nature. But for the families affected by mitochondrial disease it is a chance to have a healthy child, and to ensure that future generations are healthy too.\nWe may look back on this development as one of the key moments in science and ethics of modern times.","summary":"The decision of the government to support a ground-breaking technique for preventing serious genetic disease is a bold step for science and society.","id":"23086162"}

{"document":"In 2000, it did not recommend the appointment of Christopher Allsopp as an external member of the MPC after what they suggested was a poor performance in front of the committee, but the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, stood by him.\nSo, the committee's action against Charlotte Hogg is certainly significant.\nAnd its significance goes well beyond the future of Ms Hogg.\nMark Carney, the governor, backed her until one minute to midnight.\nWhich, after the evidence laid out by the committee today, is likely to be questioned by MPs when Mr Carney next appears before them.\nMr Carney believed that a verbal warning was sufficient and rejected Ms Hogg's offer to resign last week.\nHis judgement was that it was an oversight which had been rectified, and that Ms Hogg's contribution to the Bank - where she has worked since 2013 - far outweighed this controversy.\nAndrew Tyrie's committee did not agree.\nThat is for four distinct reasons.\nFirstly, that the \"oversight\" concerning Ms Hogg's brother's senior job at Barclays - regulated by the Bank of England - lasted for four years without any of the Bank's internal processes picking up the issue.\nSecond, that Ms Hogg was the person who drafted the Bank's own internal rule book which she subsequently breached.\nShe didn't, the Treasury Select Committee said, \"lead by example\".\nThird, the committee said that Ms Hogg, and by extension, Mr Carney, failed to appreciate the \"seriousness\" of that breach.\nAnd then suggested that future conflicts \"would not arise\".\nWhich, as the committee points out, depends - on what happens both at the Bank and at Barclays.\nThe governor has now reluctantly acted, saying that the Bank will put in place new procedures; the most significant of which is moving oversight of the Bank's code of conduct under Sam Woods, the deputy governor for prudential regulation.\nThat now means that the person who drew up the rules, the chief operating officer (until this morning Ms Hogg), is no longer responsible for their enforcement or the way they are reported to the Bank's own Audit and Risk Committee.\nMany will say the handling of the controversy over Ms Hogg has been misstep by the governor, who always needs to ensure that the Bank's adherence to its own rules is punctilious.\nMs Hogg had been widely praised as a reforming influence at the Bank, introducing new levels of transparency and driving through a reform programme that has cleared away some of the Bank's dustier attitudes.\nShe certainly had firm support from the Court of the Bank, its governing body.\nBut, in the hyper-sensitive world of bank regulation, the Treasury Select Committee has made it clear that any breach is a red card issue.\nThere are no cautions beforehand.","summary":"It is vanishingly rare for the Treasury Select Committee to not, even if sometimes reluctantly, back an appointment by the Bank of England of a deputy governor and a new member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).","id":"39265491"}

{"document":"The Richard Review says the definition of apprenticeship has been \"stretched too far\" and needs to be rethought.\nIt warns that too often the traditional relationship between the employer and the person being trained has been lost.\nThe government welcomed the report and said it would respond in due course.\nThere has been a rapid increase in the number of apprenticeships in England in recent years, with successive governments urging young people to consider them instead of university.\nBut there are concerns about quality, with some as short as three months.\nEntrepreneur Doug Richard was asked by Business Secretary Vince Cable and Education Secretary Michael Gove to consider the future of apprenticeships in England.\nIn his review, Mr Richard says \"apprenticeships or the notion of them are popular\", but that this has led to many things being called apprenticeships which, in fact, are not.\n\"Simply enough, not all instances of training on a job are apprenticeships,\" he says.\nThey \"require a new job role, a role that is new to the individual and requires them to learn a substantial amount before they can do that job effectively,\" he said.\nAs a consequence, he says, the nation risks losing sight of the core features of what makes apprenticeships work.\nAnd he suggests they should last for at least a year, adding that those \"measured in weeks or months\", can still \"fall short\".\nHe adds that while the knowledge required for a job could be covered in a shorter period of time, it took time for \"the individual to transform from an apprentice to a skilled worker\".\nThis comes after numerous complaints that some agencies and businesses have been offering low grade apprenticeships that only last for a few weeks or even months, in exchange for cheap labour and government funding.\nHe is clear that training to improve the skills of someone who has been in their job for some time or someone who is not yet ready to start work should not be called an apprenticeship.\nHe warns that that the relationship between the employer and the trainee is being lost, as schemes have become government-led training initiatives, shaped by training professionals, rather than employers.\nHe calls for a new set of qualifications which set out what a person should be able to do and know at the end of their training.\nBut they must also offer a set of skills broad enough for other jobs.\nHe said these new qualifications should be redefined by employers who should set the standard, rather than ministers.\nThey should be free of the \"bureaucratic box ticking assessment\" and \"micro-level\" prescription that he says is a feature of current vocational qualifications.\n\"It is complicated and off-putting to an employer to have to undertake paperwork gymnastics to pigeonhole their system into a redefined set of curricular approaches,\" he adds.\nHe calls for the apprentice's accomplishments to be robustly tested and validated, and says they must include high quality attainments in maths and English for those who have not got GCSEs in the subjects before they start.\nAnd he argues that apprenticeships must be \"well regarded\" if they are not to be viewed as a lower status alternative to university.\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable said the review echoed the government's current thinking on putting employers in the driving seat of training programmes.\n\"His recommendations will help us to build on the current successes.. and tailor a programme which is sustainable, high-quality and meets the changing needs of our economy in the decades to come.\"\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove said it is vital that the qualifications and assessment involved in every apprenticeship are rigorous, trusted, and give employers confidence in the ability of their apprentices.\nThe shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna called for a Tech Bacc to support the value of vocational education: \"High quality apprenticeships can give young people a crucial ladder to a successful career... but apprenticeships have to mean quality and Labour has repeatedly warned ministers that it can't mean re-labelling short courses or in-work training as apprenticeships to boost numbers.\"\nAssociation of Teachers and Lecturers general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said she agreed with the report's assertion that \"apprenticeships should deliver a valued, high-kudos route for young people, which is as equally respected as the academic route\".\n\"It is concerning however that the phrase 'light touch' is mentioned several times throughout the report. Any mention of 'light touch', particularly in regard to the approval of training organisations that provide good-quality training relevant for the sector, should be treated with caution.\"","summary":"Apprenticeships in England should last for at least a year and genuinely train someone in a new role, a key report for the government says.","id":"20496351"}

{"document":"At the same time though, they realise the Belgian jihadist's whereabouts was just one strand in a complex and evolving investigation being pursued under the enormous pressure created by the knowledge that their enemy may launch murderous follow-on attacks at any moment.\nOn Wednesday evening, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins caused consternation when he revealed that \"a new cell was neutralised\" during the bloody raid of a flat in Saint Denis and that \"this team would have been able to carry on other attacks\".\nSuddenly we realised this was not those who'd escaped Friday's atrocities and that even if Abaaoud was proven to have been there, it was a different cell, heavily armed, that according to some official briefings was about to perpetrate a massacre in the financial district of La Defense.\nSo we have received a salutary reminder that the journalistic narratives of an \"eighth man\" or an \"escaped mastermind\" often get in the way of understanding what is happening in a case like this.\nIt might be done with integrity (based on official sources leaking information for their own reasons) or it might be no more than a social media echo chamber where some speculation soon becomes a \"fact\" bemused investigators are then quizzed about.\nTheir inability to answer some of these questions might be seen as suspicious, whereas in fact it is no more than puzzlement.\nThe question of how many people the authorities are looking for is in itself a complex one because the number is being added to all the time.\nWhen Mr Molins revealed on Wednesday, for example, that one of Friday's Stade de France attackers and one of the Bataclan theatre killers remained unidentified, it indicated a certainty that once those identities had been established it would generate additional lines of inquiry, raids and quite probably arrests.\nThere have been so many of these police swoops - several hundred since Friday - that one has to ask whether they are simply taking this opportunity to bring in all sorts of jihadist suspects or whether the list of people they are looking for is much larger than we might suppose.\nAfter all, there are all manner of enablers or supporters who may be questioned for helping jihadist cells or simply complicit by their failure to report certain facts, even if they didn't have a direct role in the attack.\nFanning the flames of uncertainty to achieve maximum effect, the Islamic State (IS) group on Thursday released two videos promising more attacks.\n\"Christian countries,\" one speaker warned, \"suicide bombers are present in your country in their tens, or rather in their hundreds.\"\nWhile one might dismiss this as mere propaganda, it's clear there are hundreds of returned jihadists in Western Europe, even if relatively few of them would be prepared to carry out an IS \"martyrdom operation\".\nReturning to the central issue of the 13 November perpetrators and their immediate network, there are reasons for believing it is considerably bigger than the eight men who carried out the attack.\nThe day after these atrocities, the Iraqi government revealed it had warned France that 25 IS members were on their way from Syria.\nNow this may be wrong, not least in that it has not been proven that all of last Friday's attackers were recently arrived from the Middle East, but the discovery of a new, but connected, cell in Saint Denis, and of a car full of guns and explosives in Bavaria (a few days before Paris, but known to have been heading there), provide strong indications that Abaaoud and IS were preparing something more extensive than the eight-man assault that took place.\nThe news that Abaaoud was indeed one of those who died in the Saint Denis raid of course creates new concerns among intelligence agencies. How could an IS \"poster boy\" who had appeared in the movement's videos and been on counter-terrorist watch lists across Europe have made his way to Paris undiscovered?\nAs if this were not already disturbing enough, the authorities have added to the dread. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying: \"We must not rule out anything,\" has suggested that IS may be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in its attacks.\nFrench police have been authorised to carry their firearms at all times, on or off duty.\nReminding the public of these concerns (IS is believed to have used mustard gas chemical agent against opponents in Syria) may be no more than an ugly necessity at this time.\nBut of course Mr Valls was on Thursday guiding legislation for a three-month extension to France's state of emergency (giving sweeping powers to the authorities) through parliament.\nAs in the UK, this involves a difficult public debate about intrusion into people's privacy and the suspension of some cherished civil liberties.\nWhatever our uncertainties about the investigation, we have learned enough already to understand that it is a widening dragnet that is expanding across Europe. Multiple raids in the Molenbeek district of Brussels have been generated by intelligence coming from Paris, as well as arrests in Germany.\nEach intervention is producing new leads, and there are investigative or intelligence teams across Europe now re-examining earlier incidents, mapping individuals that might be connected to the latest discoveries.\nIt is a huge task and little wonder that the police or intelligence bureaucracies are taking their opportunity to push for bigger budgets and more people.\nAt some point, all of this will peak and the number of leads or files being closed off by investigators will start to exceed the new ones being pursued.\nMany suspects on the outer edges of the conspiracy or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time will be released. There may even be some sense of relief.\nBut of course that will simply mark the end of the story of the Abaaoud network and the 13 November attacks.\nIt would be foolish to think that Islamic State will not be trying to reinvent this model all over again with new teams of operatives dispatched to spread death on the  streets of Europe.","summary":"News that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, believed to be the ringleader of the Paris attacks, had died during a French police raid came as a welcome win for investigators.","id":"34868412"}

{"document":"It is under suspicion of meddling in the democratic process, of hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation with the alleged aim of helping a pro-Moscow candidate win the vote.\nWe heard such accusations this year in France and last year in America. Indeed, the US intelligence community has already concluded that Russia ran a campaign to influence the presidential election.\nSo, what about Britain's general election? Is the UK vote in the crosshairs of the Kremlin? Has it already been targeted by Russia's foreign intelligence service?\nLast month UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said there was a \"realistic possibility\" Russia might try to meddle. Has it? Does Moscow really care who wins the keys to Number 10?\nI suspect not. In the run-up to the American and French presidential elections, it was clear that the Kremlin did have preferences.\nThe Russian state media was full of praise for candidates Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, and scathing of candidates Hillary Clinton and Emmanuel Macron. Hardly surprising when you consider that both Mr Trump and Ms Le Pen promoted closer ties with Moscow.\nBut ahead of Britain's election, the Russian media hasn't come down on one side or the other. Indeed, there hasn't been much coverage at all of the campaign.\nSo why not?\n\"In Russia we don't see Great Britain as a fully independent country,\" says political analyst Sergei Markov, who is close to the Kremlin. \"We see it as part of America: a very junior, junior partner of Washington.\"\nIn other words, in the eyes of the Kremlin, Britain is irrelevant.\nOuch, that hurts.\nBut that is only part of the story. Crucially, a UK vote has already given Russia the result it wanted - last year, when Britain voted to leave the EU.\nAhead of the UK referendum, the Kremlin officially remained neutral.

Do they even know that Britain is going to the polls?\nTo find out I drove to the town of Reutov on the edge of Moscow.

{"document":"His victory in the small West African nation's presidential poll is arguably an even bigger shock than that of fellow property mogul in the US, Donald Trump.\nMr Barrow's opponent Yahya Jammeh, has ruled the country for more than two decades, but said if God willed it, his presidency could go on for \"a billion years\".\nBefore the 51-year-old was chosen in September as the candidate to represent seven Gambian opposition parties at the election, he had spent 10 years working in property, having started his own estate agency in 2006.\nIn the early 2000s, he lived in the UK for several years, where he reportedly worked as a security guard at the Argos catalogue store in north London, while studying for his real estate qualifications.\nBritish media have even reported that while guarding the shop on Holloway Road, he made a citizen's arrest on a shoplifter, which resulted in a six-month jail term.\nIt was also during that period that Mr Barrow chose to support Arsenal FC, at that time his local club.\nDespite the uncertainty over whether the disputed election, he recently shared a picture on Twitter of him wearing the north London club's jersey and declared support for the team:\n\"You can change your politics, but never can you change your favourite football team! Thank you Ã¢â¬â @Arsenal! #Gambia #Arsenal\"\nHe was born in 1965, the same year his country gained independence from British colonial rule, in a small village near the market town of Basse in the east of the country.\nThroughout his campaign, he pledged support for an independent judiciary, as well as increased freedom for the media and civil society.\nSix things about Adama Barrow:\nHe described his opponent as a \"soulless dictator\" and promised to undo some of Mr Jammeh's more controversial moves.\n\"We will take the country back to the Commonwealth and the International Criminal Court (ICC),\" he said.\nA devout Muslim, he also criticised the lack of a two-term limit on the presidency and condemned the jailing of political opposition figures.\nSpeaking to the BBC three days before the election, Mr Barrow said that Gambians \"had been suffering for 22 years\" and were ready for change.\nHe scorned the achievements of his opponent, who boasted of having brought The Gambia out of the stone age with his education and health programmes.\nMore on President Jammeh's rule:\nThe hospitals President Jammeh had built had \"no drugs... or quality doctors\", the schools \"no teachers, no chairs... no good educational materials\", he said.\nThey were \"white elephant projects\".\nAlthough he became treasurer of the main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) party in 2013, Mr Barrow was not a household name in The Gambia. He was described as \"little-known\" even by one of the local media outlets supporting him.\nIn an interview with a local media, Mai Ceesay, a former female UDP youth leader, describes Mr Barrow as industrious and humble, calling him the perfect candidate:\n\"He is humble, kind and industrious man who breaks the deal. He is down to the earth,\" she said.\nIn his media appearances, Mr Barrow comes across as laid back, almost guarded, but his infectious smile gives him a personable mien.\nBut he is not a rousing speaker.\nHis accidental rise came after the jailing of UDP leader Ousainou Darboe, a long time nemesis of Mr Jammeh,  who was detained months before the 1 December election after leading a protest over the alleged death of an activist in police custody.\nMr Darboe's absence may have forced the opposition parties to rally behind one candidate. He was freed on bail after the opposition won the election.\nMr Barrow, has two wives and five children, according to the Gambian newspaper The Point.\nHe was especially popular among young voters who have been badly hit by the country's struggling economy.\nOn 15 January 2017,  his eight-year-old son Habibu Barrow died reportedly after being bitten by a dog.\nMr Barrow missed his son's funeral as he was advised to remain in Senegal for his safety ahead of his inauguration  - held in his country's embassy in Dakar, Senegal, on 19 January.\nMany thousands of Gambians have made the perilous journey to Europe in search of jobs.\nSo The Gambia's new leader has great expectations on his shoulders - as he makes history in a country which has not had a smooth transfer of power in his lifetime.\nBut he has to return home, first.\nMr Jammeh has refused to stand down.

{"document":"Some youngsters fail to achieve the grades they need to get into university.\nRelatively few places are available to Scots through the clearing system which is designed to allocate \"spare\" places.\nYet a week or so later, they may feel aggrieved to find places are available to applicants from other parts of the UK.\nThe clearing system is a complex issue. It is far more subtle than a headline claiming a Scot is losing out to someone from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is the price of free tuition at Scottish university - a price the policy's supporters would say was worth paying.\nTo put this in context though, the number of places at Scottish universities available to Scots is at an historic high. By this week the number of Scottish applicants accepted to Scottish institutions had reached 30,400 - 4% up on this time last year.\nHowever, this may be little consolation to those who have lost out on the course they actually wanted to do.\nEssentially there are now three groups of students at Scottish universities.\nThis two tier system for Scottish and other UK students is the result of free tuition in Scotland.\nBut universities strongly contend that comparing students in the different categories is like comparing apples with pears.\nThey deny claims Scots are losing out to fee-paying students from elsewhere and say this shows a misunderstanding of the issue.\nRealistically the only way to end the distinction would be if tuition fees were re-introduced in Scotland or if free tuition was brought back in other parts of the UK.\nThe former would mean Scottish universities would be free to take in as many Scots as they wanted.  The latter could end the distinction in the clearing system.\nEither would probably mean that there was no hard and fast distinction between Scottish applicants and prospective students from other parts of Britain.\nUniversities Scotland is calling for discussions with the government over the total number of places available to Scots.\nIt would like to see the overall number grow to ensure that more people from disadvantaged areas can get a place without making it harder for others.

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Briton, seeded second, won 7-5 6-1 6-4 on Centre Court and will next face French 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Wednesday.\nAfter matching Murray for 40 minutes, Kyrgios' challenge faded quickly under sustained pressure from the Scot.\nMurray, the 2013 champion, is into the last eight without dropping a set.\nThe 29-year-old has now won eight matches in a row on grass, and joins Pete Sampras and John McEnroe in reaching nine consecutive Wimbledon quarter-finals.\nMurray had beaten Kyrgios at the other three Grand Slams - and he brushed aside any thought this might be the Australian's time with a brilliant display.\nThe world number two was focused throughout, winning 80% of points on the Kyrgios second serve and denying the 21-year-old a single break point.\n\"The first set was very tight. I managed to get the break at 6-5 but it was tight up to that point,\" Murray told BBC Sport.\n\"The second set was much more comfortable, Nick lost his focus a bit. I was able to dictate a lot of the rallies.\"\nAsked about the growing expectation of a second title following top seed Novak Djokovic's defeat on Saturday, Murray added: \"Every year I play here it's the same.\n\"I try my best to win my matches and go as deep as possible.\n\"The matches, as you progress, get tougher. Tsonga is next who is a tough grass-court player and I'll have to play very well to win that one.\"\nKyrgios said: \"As soon as I lost the first set, I just lost belief. It obviously felt like a mountain to climb after losing the first.\n\"He played pretty well, as well. I don't think he missed too many balls either.\"\nIt is a measure of how sharp Murray is looking that he won the opening set despite Kyrgios making 30 of 34 first serves - the bedrock of his game.\nThere were flashes of brilliance all over the court from the Australian and a tie-break appeared inevitable after 11 games without a break point, but Murray grabbed the initiative with a brilliant return game.\nA backhand pass gave the Scot a 0-30 lead before a clever cross-court chip drew a loose volley from Kyrgios, who suddenly found himself staring at three set points.\nTwo were saved with big serves but Murray drilled a cross-court forehand on the third that Kyrgios could only divert into the net.\nIf the first set was a tight, tense contest, the second disappeared in just 26 minutes as Murray maintained the quality of a tournament favourite, while Kyrgios' belief appeared to drain away.\nMurray was now peppering the baseline with his returns, drawing Kyrgios into rallies, and he made the breakthrough with another pass that the Australian could only net.\nTwo games later and the pair's much-discussed friendship appeared briefly on hold as Murray slowed the quick-fire Kyrgios serving pace, prompting the Australian to thrash a wild forehand out and hand over another break.\nMurray crunched down his sixth ace to clinch a two-set lead and broke again early in the third set thanks to three thumping forehands.\nBy now there was little prospect of the close contest many had predicted, and there were murmurs from the crowd at some careless play from the Australian, but nothing was going to distract Murray.\nJohn McEnroe, three-time Wimbledon champion: \"Murray took Kyrgios completely out of the match. He did not look under any stress at all. Considering what he was up against in Kyrgios, it was very impressive. The outcome was never in doubt.\n\"Kyrgios went through the motions in the second set. The truth is I don't think he would have won anyway, even if he played his best. The level Murray played at was extremely high. Everyone respects him - and the level he has reached - more than they ever have.\"\nPat Cash, 1987 Wimbledon champion: \"That was a real test for Murray. Nick served nearly 90% in the first set and still didn't get to a tie-break. Sometimes you think about Nick and think he needs some rewiring. I don't think he is trying sometimes, there's no doubt about it, but that's the way he plays.\n\"People are watching that match and think what's going on?

I was sat on the plane and the whole way back I had it on, it's just so special to me.\"\nFor someone who the day before had flown the best part of 5,800 miles (9,300km), she looked remarkably refreshed.\n\"I didn't get much sleep on the plane to be honest,\" she said.\n\"I was sat near the hockey girls (the gold-winning women's hockey team were the ones filmed singing God Save the Queen), then we had like a six-hour drive to get home, but once I finally got home yesterday evening I slept really well.\n\"I've got a busy week with interviews and media, next week I'll have time chilling with family and friends, then the week after that I'll get back into training.\"\nAnd on top of all that, tomorrow she gets her GCSE results, not that she's worried.\n\"It is what it is, I have to get them,\" she said.\nThe welcome-home party started as soon as she returned to her housing estate on the edge of Bishop Auckland, with neighbours ready to greet her.\nYoung fans got autographs, older ones told Amy how proud they were of her.\nBut it was at the gymnastics club, a large pink sports hall with a ÃÂ£30,000 floor and various beams, balance bars, trampolines and foam-filled pits, that she was really able to celebrate her success.\n\"She started here when she was two-years-old\" said Nicola Preston, her coach for the past 14 years.\n\"She is one of the family, we are all just so proud of her, we are pleased to have her home, we've really missed.\"\nBarely 20 minutes after Amy's arrival, the next generation of gymnasts were back to training on the various pieces of equipment.\nOne young girl said: \"Amy is an inspiration, she's shown us what can be done.

{"document":"A worldwide one-child policy would mean the number of people in 2100 remained around current levels, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nEven a catastrophic event that killed billions of people would have little effect on the overall impact, it said.\nThere may be 12 billion humans on Earth by 2100, latest projections suggest.\nConcerns about the impact of people on the planet's resources have been growing, especially if the population continues to increase.\nThe authors of this new study said roughly 14% of all the people who ever existed were alive today.\nThese growing numbers mean a greater impact on the environment than ever, with worries about the conversion of forests for agriculture, the rise of urbanisation, the pressure on species, pollution, and climate change.\nThe picture is complicated by the fact that while the overall figures have been growing, the world's per-capita fertility has been declining for several decades.\nThe impact on the environment has increased substantially, however, because of rising affluence and consumption rates.\nMany experts have argued the best way of tackling this impact is to facilitate a rapid transition to much lower fertility rates.\nTo work out the impact on population, the team constructed nine different scenarios for population change up to the year 2100, using data from the World Health Organization, and the US Census Bureau's international database.\nThey also used \"catastrophe scenarios\" to simulate the impacts of climate disruption, wars or global pandemics on population trends.\nAccording to the study, attempts to curb our population as a short-term fix will not work.\nIf China's much criticised one-child policy was implemented worldwide, the Earth's population in 2100 would still be between five and 10 billion, it says.\n\"We've gone past the point where we can do it easily, just by the sheer magnitude of the population, what we call the demographic momentum. We just can't stop it fast enough,\" said Prof Corey Bradshaw from the University of Adelaide.\n\"Even draconian measures for fertility control still won't arrest that growth rate - we're talking century-scale reductions rather than decadal scale, because of the magnitude.\"\nIn their paper, the researchers also look at the impact on numbers of a global catastrophe in the middle of this century. They found that even an event that wiped out two billion people would still leave about eight and a half billion in 2100.\n\"Even if we had a third world war in the middle of this century, you would barely make a dent in the trajectory over the next 100 years,\" said Prof Bradshaw, something he described as \"sobering\".\nThe scientists said the issue of population and its impact on global consumption was often described as the \"elephant in the room\" - a problem that the world ignores as it is politically and ethically difficult to tackle.\nBut the research shows that curbing numbers will not deal with environmental challenges in the short term.\n\"Our work reveals that effective family planning and reproduction education worldwide have great potential to constrain the size of the human population and alleviate pressure on resource availability over the longer term,\" said Prof Barry Brook from the University of Tasmania.\n\"Our great-great-great-great grandchildren might ultimately benefit from such planning, but people alive today will not.\"\nAs a result of this long-term impact, the world should focus on curbing consumption and designing ways to conserve species and ecosystems.\n\"Society's efforts towards sustainability would be directed more productively towards reducing our impact as much as possible through technological and social innovation,\" says Prof Bradshaw.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc","summary":"Restricting population growth will not solve global issues of sustainability in the short term, new research says.","id":"29788754"}

{"document":"Standing in a cool stone corridor near the heart of Eastern State Penitentiary, a sprawling Gothic prison-turned historic tourist attraction in Philadelphia, Russell Craig tried to round up an audience.\n\"In one minute, I'm about to give a tour... an exclusive, never-before-done tour,\" he called to families and couples as they ambled past, audio tour players dangling from their necks.\nEastern State, a gloomy, turreted structure looming high above an upscale Philadelphian neighbourhood, was the world's first \"penitentiary\", a word coined for the founders' hope that its inhabitants would reform through prayer and become \"penitent\".\nIt operated from 1829 until 1971, and held 1,800 men at its peak. After the last inmate left, it collapsed into a ruinous state, then reopened as a museum in 1994.\nToday, the eerily decrepit cell blocks bustle with tourists, boy scouts and girl guides, church groups and primary school field trips - in total, nearly 220,000 visitors a year.\nCraig, a tall, bearded 35-year-old dressed in a maroon tour guide's polo shirt, gradually convinced a group of 10 visitors to gather around, and led them through a door into what was once the prison chaplain's office.\nInside, the walls are covered with colourful religious murals - depictions of the resurrection of Jesus, a prisoner kneeling at the foot of a priest - though they are badly damaged from exposure to sunlight.\nThey were painted in 1955 by a prolific inmate artist named Lester Smith who served seven months for a string of armed robberies. Craig explained to the group that after his release, Smith was never imprisoned again.\n\"Why would you think that Lester would use art in prison to change his life?\" Craig asked.\nThe visitors shrugged. Someone ventured \"Something to do?\" to nervous laughter.\nCraig nodded. \"True - I can see that.\" He paused.\n\"I was in prison. I used art to change my life in the same way,\" he said. \"I'm here to give you, like, right in front of you, a live example of how art can change your life.\"\nThis is the moment the museum staff refer to as the \"face melt\" - suddenly all the visitors snapped to attention, their eyes leapt to Craig in surprise.\n\"I have examples of my work, if you would like to see,\" he offered, then pulled out a large reproduction of his prison identification card that he painted in lifelike detail.\nHe passed around the real card, too, which identifies him as \"Inmate HP9290\". In the ID photo, Craig's gaze is cold and detached. He is almost unrecognisable from the smiling, slightly bashful man standing in front of the group.\n\"I decided when I get out, I'm never going to commit crimes again, I'm [going to] be an artist,\" he told them. \"And it happened for me, just like Lester. He changed his life.\"\nAfter a string of drugs charges beginning when he was a teenager, Craig came under the tutelage of a fellow inmate serving life for murder, who was also a talented artist. Craig emerged from prison in 2013 an accomplished portraitist determined to turn his life around.\nToday, Craig is one of four formerly jailed tour guides at Eastern State. When he first arrived, he became so connected to the story of the self-taught Lester Smith - who painted saints by copying images out of old copies of Jet magazine - that he asked to give tours of the chaplain's office.\n\"Those guys are just like me way back then,\" he says.\nNothing identifies tour guides like Craig as different from the other staff roaming the halls of the prison. There is no special signage or promotion of their tours anywhere. After a year of planning, hiring and training, the tours began without announcement or fanfare in March.\n\"We are in new territory, uncharted territory,\" says Lauren Zalut, Eastern State's director of education and tour programmes, who leads the new group. \"No other museums really around the country are doing work like this.\"\nThe tours coincide with the unveiling of a new exhibit called Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration, which explores the American model of punishment. In the decades after Eastern State Penitentiary closed its doors, the state of the criminal justice system changed tremendously and the US prison population ballooned by 700%.\nThe US imprisons 2.2 million people, far more than any other country, and yet no national museum had attempted to explore the history of imprisonment.\nSean Kelley, director of public programming at Eastern State, says that he once felt that tackling issues of contemporary incarceration - especially the disproportionate number of African American prisoners  - was too controversial for their holidaying visitors.\nBut after years of careful exploration and prototyping - and a \"conversion\" for Kelley in terms of his thinking on what the purpose of the museum should be - they decided to build out a new, state-of-the-art space to hold an exhibit whose main thesis is that \"mass incarceration isn't working\".\n\"In our original mission statement, we dropped the word 'neutral' from it,\" he says.\n\"You really want to be neutral on the fact that our nation has 30% people of colour in the general population and 60% in our prisons, and it's been that way since before this building was built?\"\nThe guides' 15-minute tours turn into something of a miniature social experiment - the majority of visitors to Eastern State are middle-class white tourists, many of whom have never had any interaction with the American criminal justice system.\nOn the so-called \"pilot programme\" tours, visitors have the opportunity to speak to a person who can connect the history of the old prison with the present, with the intent to build empathy for so-called \"returning citizens\" who often struggle to acclimate to life in the free world.\n\"I'm a normal person just like you, I made a lot of poor decisions obviously, but I want them to be more informed,\" says pilot programme guide Marvin Robinson, a contemplative 29-year-old in tortoise-shell glasses. \"I think that by expressing myself and my personal experience I can give them something to think about.\"\nThe tours are purposefully unscripted and each of the guides reveals their back story differently.\nSheri, who asked that only her first name be used, waits until her tour of \"Soup Alley\", the half-collapsed kitchen and communal dining hall, is nearly over before offering her personal experience of prison food. She shares a recipe for cheesecake that she made in her cell from crumbled packaged cookies, provolone cheese and coffee creamer from the commissary.\n\"It's amazing what you can do,\" she tells visitors. \"I love cooking, so just having that experience of different ways of cooking, coming up with things, was pretty amazing.\"\nRobinson leads visitors through the dank underground \"punishment cells\" beneath Cell Block 14. Visitors have to take care to avoid knocking their heads on the low pipes, though the cells themselves had no working plumbing.\nThe American founders of Eastern State constructed the building as an alternative to the crowded, filthy communal jail cells of the 1800s as a criminal justice reform effort swept the young nation.\nThey prescribed solitary confinement, keeping inmates separated in almost total silence with a single thin window in the ceiling so they could pray and learn penitence. At the time it was seen as a revolution in humane incarceration.\nBut modern times warped that vision into a form of punishment. On his tour, Robinson reveals that he was once one of the 81,000 individuals estimated to be held in solitary confinement in the US prison system at any given time.\nDuring his time behind bars for drug trafficking, Robinson was placed in the \"SHU\", or special housing unit, for 15 months in a federal facility in North Carolina for possession of a contraband mobile phone. He tells visitors how he tried to stay mentally active by reading books, though he sometimes became too depressed to eat or even move.\n\"It takes everything from you,\" he says. \"You strip a human of everything that makes you human.\"\nThe decision to hire the formerly jailed guides to work in the museum happened almost by accident, after a man who had served time in prison joined the staff briefly. He began having unprompted conversations with guests about his time behind bars. On the museum's annual \"Prison Food Weekend\", he offered to prepare his personal recipe for chi chi - a casserole-like dish inmates concoct in their cells using items purchased from the commissary like ramen noodles, cheese curls, sausage and barbecue sauce.\nKelley says the experience helped him realise that his staff of mostly white, university-educated employees could learn a lot from a group of guides that had lived through the prison experience.\nThere were concerns about \"tokenism\" or placing the guides in a vulnerable position by having to disclose their criminal histories to strangers all day long.\nKelley says there were also worries that visitors would protest, or that having people on staff with criminal records could pose some kind of safety risk. But once they met the four people who were ultimately hired, those worries evaporated - and were replaced by others.\n\"I don't want visitors to come in explicitly looking for a formerly incarcerated person as a tour guide,\" he says. \"This becomes like adventure tourism - that is the nightmare.\"\nThough the reaction from visitors has been mostly positive - there are hugs, handshakes, even rounds of applause - the tours can also trigger complex reactions. One man responded angrily when he heard about Craig's access to a luxury like art supplies. Sheri says she, too, has noticed subtle negative responses, like a woman who began nervously pacing after Sheri revealed that she was incarcerated.\n\"She was a little snooty,\" Sheri recalls. \"They're welcome to their own opinions, I don't take offence to it.\"\nAnd then there is the fact that by disclosing their records, the guides can be exposed to a host of personal questions.\nWhen one older couple asked Craig what happened in his childhood that led to prison, he found himself explaining that he'd been taken away from his alcoholic mother by child protective services at age five, then bounced from group home to group home, eventually running away and dealing drugs to make money. When he revealed that he does not know who his father is, the woman's horrified expression was hard to miss.\n\"You gotta keep it together and stay professional,\" he recalls. \"I thought I was alright, but I was affected a little bit.\"\nOverall, however, Kelley says that visitors' receptiveness reflects the shifting public opinion on incarceration.\n\"I think there's been a national change in the tone and it's bipartisan,\" he says. \"I'm really proud to have those four voices as part of our programme. I really, honestly think it's one of the most interesting things happening in America in historic sites.\"\nLast week, Robinson, Sheri and Craig attended a cocktail party to fete the opening of Eastern State Penitentiary's \"Prisons Today\" exhibit. Robinson actually cut the ribbon, flanked on either side by academics, dignitaries from the Philadelphia mayor's office and high-ranking members of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.\nNear the entrance of the new exhibit, a hallway splits into two paths. \"Have you ever broken the law?\" a huge red sign asks. Visitors have the option to step to the left under a sign that says \"YES\" or to the right - \"NO\".\nRobinson stepped to the left, along with almost everyone in the well-heeled crowd. He passed various exhibit implements nodding approvingly.\n\"I feel like I'm a part of something bigger,\" he said. \"Something that's positive, something that's progressive.\"\nThe pilot programme will end in June - whether or not it will be renewed is still an open question, though both Kelley and Zalut feel it has been an overwhelming success.\nWhile Craig has contract work from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program and Robinson drives for a private emergency vehicle service, Sheri is still struggling to find full-time work, especially as she lives in a halfway house that has no internet access. She's trying to use the connections she's made through Eastern State to get a job helping other former inmates re-enter society.\nAt the very end of the exhibit are two glass display cases, each containing the only signs that acknowledge the existence of the pilot programme.\n\"Several of our tour guides have experienced incarceration first-hand,\" the sign reads. \"These objects hold important memories of their time in prison.\"\nCraig's side of the case is filled with artwork. Sheri donated a thin cotton head scarf that she worked for weeks at 19 cents an hour in order to afford.\nRobinson's side of the case is empty.\n\"I left everything,\" he explained. \"I wanted to just leave everything behind.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.","summary":"At a 19th Century prison that pioneered the use of solitary confinement in the US, former inmates lead one-of-a-kind tours about the history of incarceration and their own experience within it.","id":"36163247"}
{"document":"The vote, which followed the first debate on the EU Referendum Bill, means the legislation moves to the next stage of its progress through Parliament.\nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond said a \"generation\" had been denied a say on the UK's place in Europe, and the public must now have the \"final say\".\nMPs voted by 544 to 53 in favour of the bill.\nThe Conservatives and Labour support the bill, but the SNP opposes it.\nEarlier, MPs voted to reject an SNP amendment opposing the bill.\nThe bill, which has now passed its second reading and will next be examined by a committee of MPs, has several more stages to pass through.\nPrime Minister David Cameron, who first promised a referendum in 2013, has pledged to negotiate a \"better deal\" for the UK in Europe in advance of the vote - to be held by the end of 2017 at the latest.\nMr Hammond said a vote - which would be the first on the UK's links with Europe since 1975 - was needed to renew the democratic legitimacy of the UK's relationship with the 28-member body.\n\"We've had referendums on Scottish devolution, referendums on Welsh devolution, referendums on our electoral system and on a regional assembly for the North East,\" he said.\n\"But an entire generation of British voters has been denied the chance to have a say on our relationship with the European Union. And Mr Speaker, today we are putting that right.\"\nYou don't need a doctorate in mathematics to work out this was a Commons majority of rather a lot.\nWith 650 MPs in the House of Commons, persuading 84% of them to vote the same way is quite something.\nIn fact, such an achievement the result was held up because of the length of the queue of those wanting to endorse the idea of an EU referendum.\nHow did it happen?\nLabour campaigned before the general election against the idea of a referendum, saying it would be destabilising. But after what amounted, to them, to be a rather destabilising appointment with the electorate, they have changed their mind in defeat.\nFor some, this vote is something they have campaigned on for as long as they have been at Westminster: a say for the people on our place inside or outside the European Union.\nFor all of us, it is the start of a debate about how we see ourselves, our place in the world and a decision for us each to take, within the next two and a half years.\nMr Hammond added: \"We need a fundamental change in the way the European Union operates. It is now a union which has at its core a eurozone of 19 members which will integrate more closely together.\n\"There needs to be an explicit recognition those who are not part of that core do not need to pursue ever closer union. There need to be an explicit protection of the interests of those non-eurozone members as the EU goes forward.\n\"We expect to be able to negotiate a new deal which will address the concerns of the British people which we will then put to them in the promised referendum.\"\nLabour opposed a referendum during the general election campaign but has since changed its mind, saying it will not oppose the bill, although it will seek to make a number of changes, including to the franchise.\nShadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said the Labour leadership would campaign strongly in favour of the UK remaining a part of the EU, contrasting this clear position with what he said were the mixed signals from the government.\n\"The prime minister is probably for in, but he can't say definitely he's in or out because a lot of his MPs are for out unless they can be persuaded to be in,\" he said.\n\"Meanwhile, the foreign secretary who used to be leaning out now appears to be leaning in, while other members of the Cabinet who are for out read yesterday that they would be out unless they campaigned for in.\n\"Now it seems they might be in even though after all they are probably for out. In, out, in, out, it's the EU Tory Hokey Cokey - a complete mess.\"\nFormer SNP leader Alex Salmond, who tabled the SNP amendment opposing the bill, said \"no-one believed\" David Cameron wanted to take the UK out of the EU and suggested the bill was primarily designed to appease Tory backbenchers.\n\"This bill is based on a nonsense and a contradiction. Major constitutional referendums should be held on a proposition, honestly held.\n\"The prime minister proposes to hold this referendum as a political tactic... and that is why there is so much suspicion already, not just among opponents of Europe but among those who are proponents of Europe.\"\nDavid Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means:\nQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendum\nUK and the EU: Better off out or in?\nWhat Britain wants from Europe\nTimeline: EU referendum debate\nThe SNP's Angus Macneil has insisted he did not vote by mistake for the EU referendum bill despite ending up in the wrong lobby.\nDuring the second vote, the Western Isles MP entered the Yes lobby where supporters of a referendum had gathered. But he said he exited without voting once realising his error.\nDuring a six hour debate, former Chancellor Ken Clarke, one of the most pro-European voices in the Conservative Party, warned that the UK would be marginalised if it left the EU, potentially facing tariffs on imports and exports.\n\"This is about Britain's role in the modern world, the 21st century world of inter-dependent nations and how we maximise our influence by using our power base in Europe. The alternative is a fanciful, escapist route into isolated nationalism which I think will greatly diminish our influence in the world and damage our economy.\"\nBut he was challenged by former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said he was misrepresenting the views of eurosceptics.\n\"He really must not muddle the idea of the European Union, which is a political and judicial institution and the European market, which I am a most enthusiastic proponent of.\"\nAnd veteran Conservative Sir Bill Cash said the referendum was a fundamental question of \"who governs Britain\".\n\"We have a positive alternative to the EU,\" he said. Our democracy and our national Parliament is what people fought and died for in two world wars and it was through this sacrifice that we saved Europe.\"\nBoth eurosceptics and pro-European MPs have raised concerns about government plans to scrap the 28-day \"purdah\" period in the run-up to the referendum.\nPurdah usually prevents any government or civil service activity that may influence the result of an election or other vote.\nMr Clarke said he understood concerns that a purdah period would \"close down half the government's business\" but said he hoped the machinery of government was not used to give one side \"an unfair advantage\".\nMr Paterson said the decision to lift the purdah rules was \"unilateral and arbitrary\" and if the British government and the European Commission sought to \"deluge the public with information\", people may not accept the final result.","summary":"MPs have overwhelmingly backed plans for a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union.","id":"33067157"}

Will an ill-timed twinge of concern turn what would have been a solid drive into a wayward slice or cause a sure-thing birdie putt to lip out of the hole?\nHow many of his apparently unlimited supply of mulligans will he have to use to soothe a troubled mind?\nThe president may comfort himself with thoughts of low unemployment or a booming stock market. He may smile when he recalls the cheering crowds at recent campaign-style rallies or the unexpected coup of the Democratic West Virginia governor joining the Republican Party.\nBut as any vacationing piker knows, when a holiday ends there's twice as much work and a load of problems that have piled up in the meantime. Even if the president sails through his vacation without a care, there are plenty of troubles brewing back in Washington. Here's a look at some of them.\nPerhaps the single biggest legislative accomplishment of the Trump presidency so far is the law imposing new sanctions on Iran and North Korea and strengthening existing ones on Russia. Given that the president signed the measure with extreme reservations, it's safe to say things aren't going according to plan.\nEfforts to repeal and replace Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms were dramatically dynamited by a handful of Republicans and a united Democratic Party in the Senate. An overhaul of the tax law is currently barely a glimmer in legislators' eyes. The proposed modifications to the legal immigration system recently unveiled at the White House have been deemed dead on arrival in Congress, while any kind of infrastructure spending package is going nowhere fast.\nWhen the politicians return to Congress in September they will have their hands full with more pressing matters. Hardliners may attempt to prevent the treasury from issuing new government debt - raising the \"debt ceiling\" - without extracting spending cuts. New appropriations bills must be passed to avoid a government shutdown.\nAll this leaves little time for big new legislative efforts to reach fruition before the calendar flips to 2018 and legislators start thinking about their re-election campaigns.\nView from the tee: The president faces a treacherous par four, with water on both sides and sand around the green.\nIf Mr Trump's domestic agenda creates headaches, the international outlook has the makings of a splitting migraine.\nNorth Korea continues to press ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, despite harsh presidential tweets and steely gazes from the vice-president. The administration has warned of grave consequences, but what's his next step?\nMr Trump has called on China to do more - while at the same time threatening to take punitive trade measures against that nation for intellectual property theft. While Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a cordial summit in Mar-a-Lago in April, Sino-American relations could be heading toward treacherous ground.\nThe president also has some hard choices to make when it comes to Afghanistan, where his generals are calling for an increase in troop numbers to break a strategic stalemate with Taliban insurgents. While Mr Trump often has said he will defer to the Pentagon on military matters, some of his civilian advisers view an increased commitment as counter to candidate Trump's America-first foreign policy promises.\nAs if that weren't enough, Iran could also become a political flashpoint if the president follows through with his reported desire not to certify that the nation is complying with the multi-party nuclear agreement when it next comes up for review in October. It's another area where various presidential aides are giving diametrically opposed advice - and the president will have to be the decider.\nView from the tee: A high-risk, high-reward scenario where almost everyone will be relieved if the president decides to play it safe.\nAt a Thursday evening rally in West Virginia, Mr Trump attempted to paint the ongoing investigation into possible links between his campaign and Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election as an us-against-them situation.\n\"They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story,\" he said.\nThe president's speech came on the heels of news that special counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury to assist in his investigation - giving him new powers to subpoena documents, solicit sworn testimony and, with sufficient evidence, bring criminal indictments.\nOver the past weeks reports have circulated that Mr Mueller is casting a wide net in his probe, looking at the controversial June 2016 meeting between senior members of the Trump campaign and Russian advocates, as well as the business dealings of Mr Trump and those close to him.\nThen there are the ongoing congressional committee investigations. Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort have already spoken with investigators behind closed doors. They - or Donald Trump Jr - could be called for public testimony at some point in the months ahead, which would make for a national political spectacle.\nThe concurrent investigations could all end up duds - or set off explosions that shake the very foundations of the Trump presidency. The answer lies somewhere on the other side of August.\nView from the tee: In the words of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler in Caddyshack, 'The heavy stuff isn't going to come down for quite a while'.\nJust over two weeks ago Mr Trump had a chief of staff, a press secretary and no communications director. As he heads to New Jersey he has a new chief of staff, a new press secretary and a recently fired communications director.\nHe has an attorney general who says the president's swipes at him over the past few weeks were \"kind of hurtful\" and who just held a press event that seemed primarily designed to convince Mr Trump that, yes, he's trying really hard to fight leaks, just like he asked.\nHis national security adviser, HR McMaster, is systematically removing aides brought in before he took over from Michael Flynn - individuals who were more in step with White House adviser Steve Bannon's fiercely nationalistic worldview.\nAs a result Mr McMaster himself has become the target of a concerted attempt by some on the right to force him from his job. A website called McMasterLeaks featured a cartoon of the retired general as a puppet being controlled by liberal billionaire (and conservative bogeyman) George Soros, who himself was puppeteered by \"the Rothschilds\". (The website has since changed \"Rothschilds\" to \"Saudis\" after accusations of anti-Semitism.)\nThe long knives have come out over the past two weeks, forcing Republican establishment figures like Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer from their senior White House jobs.\nMr Kelly, another former general, is supposed to be bringing new discipline to the West Wing, but the verdict on his efforts won't come until long after Mr Trump has returned to the Oval Office.\nView from the tee: A golf course can't operate when the caddies are at war with each other.\nThe president has a lot to worry about as he rides around the links in his golf cart, but the real moment of reckoning may not come until he's back in the clubhouse, freshening up after his round.\nAs he checks his hair in the bathroom mirror, he may come face to face with the biggest aid - or obstacle - to his long-term presidential success. Himself.\nTime and time again over the past six-plus months Mr Trump has undermined his agenda with ill-timed tweets or off-message comments, needlessly complicating what is already the hardest job in the nation.\nHe managed to alienate several Republican senators - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona - who were instrumental in sinking his healthcare reform legislation.\nJust last week he took multiple swipes at Congress, including the leadership of his own party, saying they \"look like fools\" for not doing away with the legislative filibuster and laying the current poor state of US-Russia relations at their feet.\nGiven that the president needs Congress's help in the days ahead, such antics seem of questionable wisdom.\nAlready one Republican Senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has made a very visible break with the president. The media are buzzing with reports that others may be plotting to go their own way.\nCongress has tied the president's hands on Russian sanctions. Legislation is being drafted that would limit his ability to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller. The Senate is staying in session just to keep the president from using a procedural trick to replace Mr Sessions without their consent. Despite the president's urging, there are now bipartisan efforts to come up with ways to modify Obamacare and not repeal it.\nView from the tee: Golfing legend Ben Hogan once said \"the most important shot in golf is the next one\".

{"document":"The question: Jennie asks: \"Should we opt to leave the EU, would the duty on alcohol and cigarettes coming from Europe be reinstated?\"\nThe answer: If the UK left the EU, the specific regulations for bringing goods from the EU to the UK would depend on the agreements reached in the exit negotiations, particularly with regards to the question of whether the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU.\nCurrently, there is no duty on goods you bring from the EU provided that they are for personal use, you transport them yourself, and you have paid duty tax in the country where you bought them. There are no limits to the alcohol and tobacco you can bring in from EU countries, but you may have to prove to custom officers that the products are for personal use if the quantities suggest that you may want to resell them.\nYou can also bring tobacco and alcohol (and other goods worth up to Â£390) to the UK from outside the EU without paying duty or tax, provided that the products are for personal use and that the quantities do not exceed the specified personal allowance. For goods that exceed the personal allowance and are worth up to Â£630, a custom duty of 2.5% applies. You may also have to pay import VAT on the total value of the goods plus duty at the standard UK VAT rates.\nÂ£61bn\ntrade deficit with EU countries\nÂ£28bn\ntrade surplus with non-EU countries\nÂ£227bn UK exports to EU\nÂ£288bn UK imports from EU\n45% of all UK exports go to the EU\nThe question: Judi asks: \"A leaflet from the 'Stronger In' campaign states that the UK gets Â£66m of investment from EU countries thus creating lower prices in the shops. Are these true claims?\"\nThe answer: This is based on the 2010 European Commission report \"Trade as a Driver of Prosperity\", which says that \"trade brings a wider variety of goods and services to consumers and to companies, at lower prices. Consumer benefits alone are estimated at 600 euro per year.\"\nThe Britain Stronger in Europe campaign says 600 euro currently works out at Â£459 and they rounded it down to Â£450 per person.\nThe European Commission based its figure on a paper published in 2006 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), Oxford University Press, which looked into the US market and concluded that the gains to US consumers of the growth in global variety during the period 1972-2001 was about 2.6% of GDP.\nWe asked the Commission to clarify how they'd got the figure for the EU. They replied: \"The Commission used the estimates done for the US market because no such estimates were readily available for the EU as a whole. However, since the EU and US levels of trade openness are similar, it is not unreasonable to approximate the magnitude of EU effects based on the US figures.\"\nWe also asked the Commission whether they still stand by this figure (as it is based on a ten-year-old study which uses data from 1972 to 2001) and they replied: \"We consider this is still the most accurate estimate available for the EU as a whole.\"\nThe question: Seb asks: \"Would we need new car number plates without the EU flag?\"\nThe answer: There is no EU-wide law on vehicle registration and car number plates. Reports about EU plans to impose a standard design for vehicle registration plates have been dismissed by the European Commission.\nThe Commission website states that an EU regulation from 1998 established a model design to facilitate mutual recognition across member states. However, national governments are free to decide whether to adopt it or not.\nIn the UK, the EU symbol on the left hand side of the number plate is a voluntary identifier. Although official statistics on the number of vehicle registration plates displaying this EU identifier in the UK have not been compiled, this means that many British number plates would not be affected by the outcome of the EU referendum.\nThe British Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency informed the BBC that there has been no discussion about what would happen to those number plates that currently do include the European identifier, should Britain decide to leave the EU.\nThe question: Martin asks: \"If we leave, can we have incandescent light bulbs back?\"\nThe answer: That depends on whether we want them back. In theory, if we leave the EU then that sort of legislation on environmental issues would come back to the Westminster Parliament. In practice, it is unlikely that incandescent light bulbs would be brought back. They have long been a target for green campaigners, concerned about climate change. Production of 60 and 100-watt bulbs has been phased out in Europe but you can still use them if you have a stock.\nThe presumption is that, if the UK decides to leave the EU, all the existing rules would be in place while the UK and the EU negotiate a deal.  For example, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are fully integrated in the EU Single Market but are not members of the EU. This means they have to comply with EU regulations. You can find out more about the particular trade deals the UK might have to negotiate in the event of a British exit from the EU here.\nSome trade regulation sets minimum requirements for how energy efficient common household items, like kettles and vacuum cleaners, should be. As we've outlined here, there are currently no plans to regulate British kettles, though they are being reviewed under an EU directive. Another EU regulation will abolish roaming charges in EU member states from 2017, though we can't say for sure whether this would affect British consumers if the UK voted to leave the EU.

{"document":"His British Bloodhound Super-Sonic Car (SSC) is aiming for 800mph (1,290km\/h).\nTo achieve this extraordinary speed, the RAF man will depend on many cutting edge technologies and components - not least the actual \"floor\" itself.\nThis piece of titanium panelling will be one of the hardest working engineering elements on the vehicle.\nIt has to protect the underside of the car from the blizzard of dust and grit that will be produced as Bloodhound streaks across the dry lake surface of Northern Cape's Hakskeen Pan.\nOne of the strongest primary shockwaves will form right between the supersonic vehicle's front wheels.\nThis will turn and churn the dried mud, and, with the help of the spinning wheels, shotblast Bloodhound's body.\nWhen Andy Green set the existing record of 763mph (1,230km\/h) in 1997, his Thrust machine was badly eroded by the playa it kicked up in its path. Thrust's aluminium floor was polished to a high-sheen finish and rubbed wafer thin in places.\nThe new titanium floor just finished at Bloodhound's technical centre in Bristol hopes to perform much better in even more demanding circumstances.\n\"At Swansea University, we set up a test rig where we took the same material from Hakskeen and fired it at different panels to find the material that would cope in this high-speed eroding environment - and that was titanium,\" explained Conor La Grue, the components chief on the Bloodhound project.\nThe new floor was assembled by a team from 71 Squadron, whose normal day job is to keep the jets of the Royal Air Force in a state fit to fly.\nThe structure contains about 240 primary parts and has required roughly 1,000 worker hours to put together.\nAs well as two broad titanium skins, the floor structure incorporates a multitude of other sections, including ribs, stiffeners, stringers, edge members, straps, buttstraps, doublers, brackets and cover plates.\nAnd the whole structure is held together by 54 anchor nuts, bolts, washers and bushes, and 4,547 aerospace grade rivets.  These rivets require immense patience to emplace.\nEach rivet hole involves pilot drilling, de-burring, pinning, drilling out to full diameter, de-burring again, pinning again, counter sinking and de-burring a final time.\n\"71 Squadron have been incredible. Their skill of hand is quite extreme, and they're amazing to watch,\" observed La Grue.\nAnd yet, all of this exquisite work will essentially be seen by no-one because it will be hidden under the car. But work, it must.\nIt is quite possible that the shockwave created between the front wheels will travel ahead of the car, pulverising the desert surface layer fractions of a second before Bloodhound arrives, creating even more mess for the floor to deal with.\n\"There's an interesting premise here that the shock energy will travel faster through a solid than through air,\" said La Grue.\n\"So, potentially, the ground ahead of the car could already be coming apart before the car gets to it. We won't know that for sure until we start running, but it would only make the scenario worse because you'd already have loose material available even before the wheels and the shockwave pick it up and throw it all over the place.\"\nThe assembly of Bloodhound is now reaching a critical phase.\nBritish aerospace companies involved in the project are sending their components to Bristol for final integration.\nThe plan is to roll Bloodhound out the door in late summer for a slow-speed test on the runway of the Newquay Aerohub in Cornwall.\nAssuming that goes well, the vehicle will then be shipped to South Africa to begin its assault on the land speed record.\nThe intention is to smash that this year before returning to Hakskeen Pan in 2016 to raise the mark beyond 1,000mph (1,610km\/h).\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","summary":"When Andy Green \"floors it\" in the South African desert later this year, he expects to be able to break his 18-year-old land speed record.","id":"32800696"}

{"document":"But his term in office has been dogged by the deep schism between his own Fatah movement in the West Bank and the militant Hamas movement, which controls the Gaza Strip.\nMr Abbas, opposed to armed struggle and committed to pursuing an independent Palestinian state through negotiations, has enjoyed strong support from the international community.\nUnder his leadership, US and European money has flowed into the West Bank to build up security forces which he has used to crack down on militant activity and Hamas's political infrastructure.\nBut in the face of scant progress from years of negotiations, and the tough stance of the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu elected in early 2009, his strategy has looked increasingly bankrupt to many Palestinians.\nA year after Mr Abbas won presidential elections, he suffered a major blow as Hamas gained a sweeping victory in legislative polls.\nA short-lived unity government was formed after months of wrangling, but fell apart in June 2007 as factional street battles broke out in Gaza and Hamas drove Fatah's security forces from the Strip.\nFrom then on, Mr Abbas ruled the West Bank only, essentially by presidential decree.\nAnd when his four-year term ended in January 2009, Hamas declared him illegitimate - although he argued that the Palestinian basic law called for presidential and legislative elections to be held at the same time, so he could legally stay in post for a further year until legislative polls due in January 2010.\nIn November 2008, he also was elected \"president of a future Palestinian state\" by the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\nHe had been chairman of the umbrella body - which represents Palestinian political factions (although not Hamas) and conducts negotiations with Israel - since the death of its previous leader, Yasser Arafat, in 2004.\nBut the move was seen as a way of shoring up his authority.\nMr Abbas has walked a delicate line between appeasing Israeli and US demands that he improve security and participate in peace negotiations, and popular Palestinian pressure for genuine political and economic progress.\nAnd he has, in the past year, undermined his already fragile poll ratings with misjudged comments and actions.\nEven Fatah supporters were angered when Mr Abbas was slow to condemn the punishing military assault that Israel launched on Gaza in December 2008, and criticised the Hamas rocket fire Israel said it was trying to end.\nAnd Mr Abbas's credibility suffered further when the PA initially agreed, under Israeli and US pressure, to allow the postponement of a UN vote on the Goldstone report which was heavily critical of Israel's conduct during the operation.\nBut, under him and his appointed Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the West Bank economy has shown signs of improvement while Gaza has suffered under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at weakening Hamas.\nBorn in Safed in British Mandate Palestine in 1935, he is one of the few surviving founder members of Fatah - the main political grouping within the PLO.\nIn exile in Qatar during the late 1950s, he helped recruit a group of Palestinians to the cause. They went on to become key figures in the PLO.\nHe co-founded Fatah with Arafat and accompanied him into exile in Jordan, then Lebanon and then Tunisia. In the early days of the movement, he became respected for his clean and simple living.\nMr Abbas studied law in Egypt before doing a doctorate in Moscow.

It believes Western policy in the region has been self-serving and wildly naive.\nExisting regimes have been toppled leaving little more than chaos in their wake.\nWith the UN General Assembly in New York fast approaching, Mr Putin is eager to embark upon a new initiative on the world stage; one that will highlight Russia's distinctive voice, but one that also will underline what he sees as Moscow's irreplaceable role in the international system.\nSo seen in this light, the Russian deployment to Syria may already have achieved much of what Mr Putin is seeking.\nFor a start Russia has demonstrated that it is a strategic player in the region and is prepared to put its military might behind its diplomacy.\nIt has also demonstrated that its support for President Bashar al-Assad, at least for the short- and medium-term, is solid and a factor with which all other actors must contend.\nOn the purely diplomatic front, the US has reopened military talks with Moscow.

{"document":"It is the big-screen release Wales' football fans have been waiting for - the movie that transforms Gareth Bale and his Wales Euro 2016 teammates from sports stars to film stars.\nBut when film icon Sir Michael Gambon likes the sounds of \"Don't Take Me Home\" so much that he fancies dropping by this week's London premiere then you realise the sporting storyline is a little special.\n\"When you hear a movie legend like that, likes the story then you know you've got a storyline that has a wide appeal beyond Welsh football,\" said director Jonny Owen.\nDon't Take Me Home, named after Wales football fans' Euro 2016 terrace anthem, premieres fittingly on St David's Day.\nBut like Wales' down-to-earth players, the official premiere is far from the glitz and glamour of Leicester Square but more an industrial park outside of Pontypridd.\nBut in the week that Leicester City's fall from Premier League grace finally unravelled with the sacking of their manager, you might be forgiven for thinking this is just an overindulgence about just another sporting fairytale.\nHardly.\nThis starts with the most tragic of beginnings - the death of Wales football manager Gary Speed.\nA group of young players, most of whom were friends after growing up together in Welsh youth teams, had to deal with the grief of not just losing their boss but their role model.\nIn that context, what they achieved less than five years later - qualifying for Wales' first major championship finals in almost 60 years - seems \"worthy of immortalising in film\".\nIt was certainly beyond the wildest fantasies of any Welsh football fan - especially when they were below Haiti and Guatemala at 117 in the world rankings in 2011.\nThen in November of the same year, Speed was found hanged in his garage, aged just 42.\nIt did not just resonate in Wales and football, Speed's death shocked the country.\n\"Wales were constantly suffering so-called heartache, failing to qualify for tournaments at the final hurdle, but Gary's tragic death put those disappointments into perspective,\" said Owen.\n\"Gary's death was obviously devastating for his family and friends, but the sadness and grief must have affected this group of young lads who were loving playing football for one of their Welsh footballing heroes.\n\"It seemed to have a profound affect on them. It seemed to galvanise an already pretty strong bond, a togetherness and also context - as if they could come through this, then playing football and dealing with that pressure would be easier.\n\"No-one could have predicted then that virtually the same team would create history at Euro 2016 - those boys have some character.\"\nThe rise to the European Championships was Roy of the Rovers stuff.\nBuilt on a foundation of structured defending with the added sprinkle of stardust from the world's most expensive player, Wales defied the odds and not just qualified for their first finals since the 1958 World Cup - they reached the semi-finals.\nNo other team in history has risen up Fifa's world rankings quicker than Wales. From 117 to eighth in four years.\nBut that meant nothing without qualification for a finals. Wales had promised qualification a dozen times before, only to come up short.\nBut Chris Coleman's team became one of the smallest nations to qualify for a major tournament - and they even did it with a game to spare.\nEverywhere you looked in the Wales team, there were personal battles to overcome.\nAaron Ramsey, the player who battled back from a double leg break in 2010, was singled-out by many as the player of the tournament.\nWhile Hal Robson-Kanu, whose sensational goal in the quarter-final win over Belgium will go down as one of the greatest strikes in any tournament, did not even have a club.\nSo it was no surprise Wales took the Euros by storm with a chilled-out and friendly approach that turned them into everyone's favourite second team.\nFrom Joe Ledley's dancing and Bale winding-up England to the squad cheering England's exit on social media and Chris Gunter's \"chin-up\" message to Welsh fans - this was a team at one with itself.\n\"The rapport the team had with the fans made the Euros extra special for me,\" said Owen, a director once described by the Guardian as football's greatest film-maker.\n\"It was like 'we've waited almost 60 years for this so let's enjoy it'.\"\n\"It was one the most memorable of summer for the Welsh - and everyone was getting involved - from Cerys Matthews, Michael Sheen, Ioan Gruffudd to the Manics and the Prince of Wales.\n\"It was more than just a football tournament for us, it was more of a cultural event that every Welsh man or woman wanted to be a part of,\" Owen said.\n\"It was a very special time - I just hope the film does it justice.\"\nThe Welsh public has certainly responded as once the film goes on general release this Friday, there are 80,000 possible cinemas seats across Wales and the UK.\n\"Ticket sales have been phenomenal,\" added Owen.\n\"We put 10,000 seats on sale initially and they went. So 80,000 are now on sale which is the amount of fans that went to France last summer.\n\"To put it into perspective, if 40,000 turn up then it flies into [the] top 10 in the box office - that would be crazy.\"\nThe latest film royalty to show an in interest in attending the Don't Take Me Home premiere is Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson - star of 1992 cult movie White Men Can't Jump.\nIronic really as Wales could have done with Harrelson when Cristiano Ronaldo out-jumped the Welsh defence in that semi-final defeat to Portugal.","summary":"\"When Professor Dumbledore from Harry Potter likes the story, you know you're in business.\"","id":"39072865"}

{"document":"Four people died when the CHC Super Puma plunged into the sea on its approach to Sumburgh in August 2013.\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said a lack of monitoring meant a reduction in air speed was not noticed by the pilots.\nAttempts to recover were too late.\nThe report stated the investigation identified two main \"causal factors\".\nIt said: \"The helicopter's flight instruments were not monitored effectively during the latter stages of the non-precision instrument approach.\n\"This allowed the helicopter to enter a critically low energy state, from which recovery was not possible.\n\"Visual references had not been acquired by the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) and no effective action was taken to level the helicopter, as required by the operator's procedure for an instrument approach.\"\nThe report explained: \"The decreasing airspeed went unnoticed by the pilots until a very late stage, when the helicopter was in a critically low energy state.\n\"The commander's attempt to recover the situation was unsuccessful and the helicopter struck the surface of the sea.\n\"It rapidly filled with water and rolled inverted, but was kept afloat by the flotation bags which had deployed.\"\nNo evidence was found of any engineering issues causing the crash.\nPassengers Sarah Darnley from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, from Winchester, lost their lives in the crash on 23 August 2013.\nFourteen people were rescued.\nThe report said the impact with the water was \"survivable\".\nOf the four dead, the conclusions said one was unable to escape, one was incapacitated by a head injury, one drowned before reaching the surface, and the other died in the life raft from a chronic heart condition.\nA total of 28 safety recommendations have been made but the report said many of them have already been implemented.\nAn initial AAIB report already found the crew failed to notice the helicopter's air speed dropping until it was too late.\nIn February 2014, the Civil Aviation Authority announced a series of measures aimed at improving offshore helicopter safety following an inquiry set up in the wake of the Shetland crash.\nThey included helicopters not being allowed to fly offshore in severe sea conditions, passengers having to be seated next to emergency exits, and a size limit for those on board.\nDuncan Trapp, vice president for safety and quality at CHC Helicopter, said: \"CHC deeply regrets the tragic Sumburgh accident, and we continue to extend our sympathies to the survivors and to the loved ones of those who died.\n\"Our priority is always the safety of our passengers and crews and we would like to thank the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) for its thorough investigation.\n\"Although the AAIB makes no recommendations specific to CHC, immediately after the accident, and in the time since, we put in place additional measures to further improve safety.\n\"Among those actions, we have enhanced crew monitoring procedures and supported the industry-wide deployment of improved emergency breathing systems and training for offshore passengers and crew.\"\nA Crown Office spokesman said: \"The Crown welcomes the publication of the report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch into the Sumburgh helicopter crash on 23 August 2013.\n\"The report's findings will be fully considered as part of the parallel investigation by Police Scotland, working with the assistance of the Civil Aviation Authority and under the direction of the Crown.\n\"We will endeavour to carry out our investigation as quickly as possible but the investigation is highly complex and challenging and requires specialist input from those with the necessary expertise in civil aviation.\n\"We will continue to keep the families advised of progress with the investigation.\"\nThe British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said: \"The Sumburgh incident was a tragedy for all those involved.

{"document":"Dead Sheep focuses on the events leading up to Howe's infamous 1990 resignation speech, in which he savaged his long-time boss and one-time political soulmate Margaret Thatcher.\nThat speech - one of the first to be shown on television live from the House of Commons - was the beginning of Thatcher's downfall as prime minister.\nIt was all the more remarkable because no one thought Howe had it in him to be Thatcher's political assassin. Least of all Thatcher herself.\nHowe had been at her side as her chancellor, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister since the very beginning of her reign in Downing Street.\nBut he was often viewed as an ineffectual yes-man, and was someone she increasingly treated with impatience and disdain, in front of cabinet colleagues.\nThe play's title comes from one of the most widely-quoted political put-downs of all time, when Labour's Dennis Healey described being attacked by Howe as like being \"savaged by a dead sheep\".\nHowe's frustration at Thatcher's increasingly strident anti-EU stance at a time when he was trying to negotiate Britain's membership of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, and his demotion to the \"non-job\" of deputy prime minister, was the trigger for his resignation.\nHis resignation speech, given two weeks after he quit the cabinet, stunned the Commons into silence, as he compared himself to a cricketer who had been sent out to the crease, only to discover his bat had been smashed by the team's captain.\nBut in an era packed with larger-than-life Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Alan Clark and Thatcher herself, the famously uncharismatic Howe is still not the obvious choice to place centre stage.\n\"I just admire him so much because he really, really meant it. In all these films and plays I've seen he gets treated like a shifty-eyed buffoon and I was thinking 'No!,'\" playwright Jonathan Maitland told BBC News after the play's opening night.\n\"I've read his book umpteen times. He agonised over it and he really, really cared.\n\"And it was a very difficult thing for him to do and he stood up and did the right thing for his country and his party and I just think that's incredibly heroic. He's just a hero. He's a political hero.\"\nMaitland is hoping Dead Sheep will strike a chord with fellow Howe fans.\n\"A lot of people have nursed a secret admiration for him, because he's like Captain Mainwaring meets William Gladstone.\"\nThe play focuses on Howe's relationship with the two formidable women in his life - Margaret Thatcher and his wife Elspeth. Maitland describes him as a \"panda between two lionesses\".\n\"It's a personal drama. It's a love story. Two types of marriage - Geoffrey's and Elspeth's, and Geoffrey's and Margaret's. One's a traditional marriage, one's a political marriage.\"\nHe admits to using a bit of dramatic licence when it comes to portraying Howe's wife, played by Jill Baker, in the Lady Macbeth mould - a key scene sees Elspeth, encouraging a hesitant Howe, played by James Wilby, to go for the jugular in his resignation speech.\n\"The truth is she saw the speech the night before and she said 'are you sure you want to go that far?'\n\"That's not very dramatic, so in the play, he's written a stinker, he feels bad about it, she turns him round and inspires him to write a better one.\"\nElspeth did inspire the speech, insists Maitland, \"not quite the way it appears in the play but I don't think anyone will accuse us of being dishonest.\"\nHe admits it was a risk casting a man, Steve Nallon, as Thatcher. Nallon, who voiced Thatcher on Spitting Image, gives a pitch perfect reproduction of Thatcher's voice and mannerisms.\n\"He gives it a kind of comic energy which it otherwise wouldn't have, if an ordinary actress was playing Thatcher,\" says Maitland.\n\"He gives an incredible performance and it's a risk I'd take every day of the year.\"\nMaitland believes the play has a lot of contemporary relevance, particularly with the ongoing debate about Britain's relationship with Europe, but above all, he says:  \"I wanted it to be a love letter to old style politics, where being rubbish on TV didn't matter.\n\"And I think it tells us that's OK to stick to your guns and do something that's really unpopular and to fall on your sword. Because so many politicians these days wouldn't have the guts to do that.\"\nMaitland, a former BBC journalist, has spoken about the paucity of right wing drama on the British stage, but he tells me:  \"I wouldn't want anyone to think this is a right wing play.\n\"What it is, is not a left wing play. I just think it's healthy and desirable, as does Nicholas Hytner, the departing director of the National Theatre, to have plays that don't always come at it from the left.\"\nDead Sheep, by the Cahoots Theatre Company, is at the Park Theatre, in Finsbury Park, until 9 May.","summary":"The grey, unassuming Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe of Aberavon, is not many people's idea of a political hero - but a new play opening in north London aims to change that.","id":"32166352"}

{"document":"A study, published in the journal Nature, showed that mice spending pregnancy in complete darkness had babies with altered eye development.\nIt indicated tiny quantities of light were needed to control blood vessel growth in the eye.\nThe researchers hope the findings will aid understanding of eye disorders.\nIf you could journey inside a mouse or a person, there would not be enough light to see. However, tiny quantities of light do pass through the body.\nThis effect has already been used to film an infection spreading through the body.\nNow scientists - at the University of California, San Francisco, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center - believe that body-penetrating light can alter the development of the eye, at least in mice.\nNormally, a network of blood vessels known as the hyaloid vasculature is formed to help nourish the retina as it is constructed.\nHowever, the blood vessels would disrupt sight if they remained, so they are later removed - like scaffolding from a finished building.\nThe researchers said this did not happen when the pregnancy was spent in total darkness.\nThe critical period was around 16 days - which is very late in mouse gestation, but corresponds to the first trimester in people.\n\"It's not something subtle here, it's a major effect on the way the retina develops that requires light going through the body,\" said Prof Richard Lang, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital.\nHe said it was a \"huge surprise\" that this was happening.\nThe researchers hope their findings may aid understanding of human diseases of the eye, as many are down to blood vessels.\nSome babies born prematurely develop \"retinopathy of prematurity\", when the blood vessels in the eye grow abnormally resulting in damage to the retina and a loss of vision.\nProf Lang said: \"In retinopathy of prematurity there is overgrowth of blood vessels and that's what you see in these mice.\"\nThe researchers showed that light was activating in the mice a protein, melanopsin, which also has a role in regulating the body clock, and is present in people. However, whether the same processes take place in people or other animals is unknown.\nProf Robin Ali, from University College London, said it was a \"fascinating study\".\nHe said more research was still needed, but the findings may lead to considerations of light levels during pregnancy and efforts to grow retinas in the laboratory.\nHe said: \"It gives us a whole new aspect to consider in in the development of the retina.\n\"It illustrates how much we've yet to understand about the eye.\"","summary":"Light passing through the body and into the womb has an important role in the developing eye, US researchers have discovered.","id":"21040254"}

One possibility would be for the UK to seek membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) like Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\nThat would allow the UK to trade goods and services freely with the EU in exchange for financial contributions and the continued acceptance of free movement of people.\nBut it would take the UK out of the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the customs union, allowing it to strike its own trade deals with non-EU countries.\nTo join the EEA, ministers would first need to apply for membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\nAt a meeting of EFTA countries in Geneva, the current chair, Iceland's foreign minister Lilja Alfredsdottir, told the BBC her country would be keen to see a UK membership application, even if only on a temporary basis.\n\"From an Icelandic point of view, yes we would welcome that,\" she said, \"because I believe EFTA would be stronger with the UK inside\".\nNorway's trade minister, Monica Maeland, said there had been \"no signal\" from the UK that it would want to join EFTA.\nIf the UK did submit an application, she said there would be a willingness in EFTA to discuss it.\nMs Maeland also indicated that she had discussed the potential need for the UK to have transitional arrangements with Lord Price, who is a minister in Liam Fox's new Department for International Trade.\n\"That was something Price was talking about... what are we going to do in the meantime?

{"document":"They say the rapid test, which looks for a chemical in the blood, would reduce stress for patients, save money and ease pressure on hospital wards.\nTrials on 6,304 people, published in the Lancet medical journal, suggested it was 99.6% accurate.\nThe British Heart Foundation said the test would produce faster answers without affecting patient safety.\nAbout one million people attend A&E departments in the UK with chest pain, only for most of them to be sent home after a sometimes lengthy and anxious stay.\nThey have levels of troponin, a chemical released by damaged heart muscle, tested when they are admitted and again 12 hours later.\nThe new test also looks for troponin, but can detect much lower levels and needs to be done only once. So those given the all-clear can go straight home.\nThe study, led by the University of Edinburgh and taking place in Scottish and US hospitals, estimated that two-thirds of patients could be discharged much more quickly.\nDr Atul Anand, one of the researchers and a physician at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, told the BBC News website: \"It's really exciting. When you look at patients who come to medical wards with chest pain, 80% are going home 12 hours later.\n\"This avoids the hassle, cost and patient stress.\"\nHe said the test cost less than ÃÂ£10 although not all hospitals currently had the facilities to perform the more sensitive test.\nHowever, Dr Anand said it would be \"pretty straightforward\" to introduce and there was a \"clamouring\" to do.\nLast year the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended the NHS uses the more sensitive troponin testing kit however it is unclear when the NHS will move from a double to a single test.\nBy Dominic Hughes, health correspondent\nThree years ago I woke in the middle of the night with crushing chest pains and was rushed to my local hospital.\nOnce we reached A&E I was given a blood test, looking for the chemical troponin, but the existing test has to be repeated after at least six hours.\nSo there I lay, waiting anxiously for the result, taking up a valuable bed.\nLike 80% of people with chest pain, it wasn't a heart attack, just a footballing injury gone haywire.\nBut this new test would have saved me some anxious moments, and freed up capacity in a busy A&E.\nProf Jeremy Pearson, from the British Heart Foundation, said: \"A faster, more accurate diagnosis of whether chest pain is caused by a heart attack would be better for patients and save the NHS money.\n\"No-one wants to be in hospital unless they have to be.\n\"What's important about this study is that the evidence shows you can quickly and confidently rule out a heart attack without compromising patient safety.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.","summary":"A blood test can more than halve the number of people admitted to hospital with a suspected heart attack, say doctors.","id":"34464484"}

{"document":"India is already the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and it plans a massive increase, proposing to treble CO2 emissions within the next 15 years.\nWhat is more, unlike virtually every other country attending the Paris conference - including the two biggest polluters, the US and China - India has not set a future cap on emissions, let alone proposed cuts.\nThat's because, for India, economic growth comes first.\nAnd because India's energy policy is based on coal - the dirtiest fuel there is - the pace of economic growth sets the rate of emissions.\nThe scale of what India is planning becomes shockingly real when you visit one of the country's many open cast coal mines.\nLooking across the vast pit is impressive enough: the opposite bank blurs into the blue distance.\nBut it is only when you get up close to the operations that you get a true sense of scale.\nThe dozens of bright yellow trucks you saw from your eyrie rumbling with their loads across the valley floor take on vast proportions.  Every one of this monstrous insect army is the size of a family home.\nBut even these behemoths are dwarfed by the queen that squats at the heart of the operation.  She is a true titan, a giant crane whose gaping jaws take great bites from the 20 metre high wall of coal before spewing it into the waiting trucks.\nAnd the numbers are as large as the machines.  India plans to open a mine like this every single month until 2020 as part of its strategy to double coal output to a billion tonnes a year.\nAnd, it can maintain that output for the next 300 years, if it so wishes, because according to the Indian coal ministry the country has 301 billion tonnes of accessible coal.\nNow hold those huge numbers in your mind as you recall the ambitions of Paris conference: to reduce carbon emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.\nIt isn't hard to conclude that India is effectively saying to the world: \"Climate change is your problem, you deal with it!\"\nBut India has some powerful arguments to justify its position.\nIt talks in terms of \"climate justice\".\nFirst off, it says it isn't responsible for the emissions that are causing the current warming.  That's down to the developed world which used fossil fuels to power its path to wealth.\nIf you look at emissions since 1850 - what is sometimes called the \"carbon space\" - then US is responsible for a third of the total, Europe and the other developed countries for 45%.\nIndia, according to figures from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, accounts for just 3% of emissions to date.\nAnd that tiny total explains why India is still so poor.\nRemember, India is the second most populous country in the world with one and a quarter of a billion people.  Hundreds of millions of those still live in terrible poverty.\nIndia's enduring poverty explains the second arm of India's argument: the fact that Indians use way less carbon than most other people.\nOnce again the figures are stark.  The average Indian is responsible for just 1.6 tonnes of CO2 a year.  Meanwhile, the average American accounts for a whopping 16.4 tonnes, the average Japanese for 10.4 tonnes and the average European for 7.4 tonnes.\nThe world average is 4.9 tonnes.\nSo India's position is that it is only fair that it should be allowed to use some of the remaining \"carbon space\" to fuel growth and help lift its people out of poverty.\nBut the science is clear.  All new carbon emissions add to global warming.\nSo alongside its development of its coal industry, India says it will make huge investments in renewable technologies.  It claims to have the most ambitious plans to develop solar and wind power in the world, planning to add 175 GWs of renewable power by 2022.\nIf India achieves that - and it is a big \"if\" - then it will help reduce what is known as \"emissions intensity\" - the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy produced - by about a third.\nThat is a laudable ambition but it doesn't avoid the key problem - the fact the India's policy means a huge increase in emissions.\nAnd that is the big challenge at Paris.  Because the inescapable conclusion is that if India - and other developing countries - are going to be able to grow, then other countries will need to make even deeper cuts to their emissions to give them the space to do so.\nEffectively what India is demanding is that other countries agree to reduce their economic growth - not something any politician would normally agree to.\nBut the omens are good.  These aren't new arguments, and much of the groundwork for an agreement has already been done.\nAn incredible turnout is expected.\nLeaders from 138 countries, including Barack Obama, Premier Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, have said they will attend. Not a single leader pulled out in the wake of the Paris attacks earlier this month.\nIndeed some people are saying the Paris attacks may actually bode well for the conference, with the leaders wanting to be able to point to a concrete agreement on global warming as a symbol of the world's ability to come together to achieve good.\nBut the scale of India's ambitions gives you a clear sense of just why getting such an agreement in Paris is such a challenge.\nAnd why it will be such a triumph if it is achieved.","summary":"If any single country embodies the challenge of reaching an agreement at the huge United Nations climate conference that begins in Paris on Monday, it is India.","id":"34929578"}

They have the same sponsor - Etihad Airlines - and also wear sky blue shirts.\nOn 6 July, the club announced Pirlo had joined them from Juventus, becoming their third 'Designated Player' - each club can sign up to three players whose wages exceed the salary cap - alongside Lampard and Spain World Cup winner David Villa.\nNYC FC began their debut campaign with a 1-1 draw at Orlando on 8 March and beat New England Revolution in front of 43,507 in their first home game at Yankee Stadium the following week.\nResults since then have been patchy and the 4-4 draw with Toronto left them second bottom of the Eastern Conference, three points off a play-off place.\nCrowds remain good - they attracted their highest attendance, 48,047, to the 'derby' with New York Red Bulls on 28 June and their average gate of 28,785 is only beaten by Seattle Sounders (40,236) and Orlando (34,005) in MLS.\n\"There is a long way to go but New York is the most diverse city in America,\" said first-time fan, Scott Carey, 23. \"That will jump start it.\"\nOpinion is split.\nLocal shopkeeper Saeed Abbad is impressed.\n\"When they get big crowds - like the Red Bulls game - the atmosphere is exactly the same as when the Yankees are playing,\" he said.\n\"Remember, the Yankees have been going for 114 years. The soccer team has hardly been here for that many days.\"\nOthers are not so sure.\n\"New York City won't do anything for football in this country,\" said Cody Kaczetow, 23, another first-timer.\n\"It is not going anywhere in terms of how people respect it. It will probably still be the same when I am 80.\n\"Kids who play soccer will still get called 'foot fairies' at school and baseball will remain 'America's pastime'. I think as a nation, we are too stubborn to change that.\"\nReyna is undeterred.\n\"We have had some challenges and some difficult patches, which were to be expected from a new franchise,\" he said.\n\"But if you take a step back, in a little over two years we have created a new club to compete in a very difficult league.\n\"We recognise a need to improve. But, to capture an audience, create an excitement and get people behind the team the way we have done in such a difficult market, has been remarkable.\n\"It proves there is an appetite for football in New York City.\"\nNYC FC are committed to using Yankee Stadium for three seasons.\nThe location is not without its issues. Whilst fans are reasonably close to the action on three sides of the famous stadium, they are a long way from the pitch on the dressing room side, where the pitcher's mound, batters' boxes and coaches' boxes are located.\nAnd the restrictions mean that, at 70 yards, the pitch's width only just meets Fifa's international regulations.\nBut they will stay there until a new home is found - a new home that, unlike that of the Red Bulls, is in one of New York's five boroughs; Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.\n\"Red Bulls are New Jersey. I grew up in New Jersey. Anyone who comes from there knows it is not New York. They are proud residents of a different state,\" said Reyna.\n\"We want to be in one of the boroughs. In a short time we will have some updates to share but at the moment we are focused on playing here.\n\"We are happy here. It feels like home. We have got used to the surface.

{"document":"That enemy is the fear that many undocumented Hispanics have about presenting their personal information to the immigration authorities for a programme that could be reversed by a new administration in a matter of years.\n\"This deferred action is a temporary permit,\" says Claudia, who fled from violence in her native Mexico and has been living in the US since 2000.\n\"What is going to happen when Mr Obama is no longer president? They are going to know where I am, where my family is. Is it possible that we will all be deported?\" she tells the BBC in El Paso, Texas.\nIn November, President Obama announced a series of unilateral reforms that will allow about four million unauthorised immigrants to apply for provisional work permits, and for deportation proceedings to be deferred.\nClaudia explains that she is eligible because she has been in the United States for nearly 15 years and has three sons who are married to American citizens, making them legal residents.\nShe says she plans to apply for relief, even though she is still very sceptical of the programme because it will not resolve her legal situation in the long term.\n\"With this announcement, there is no hope, you don't know where your future lies,\" she stresses.\n\"Before, you knew you were undocumented and you had to be on the lookout for the immigration authorities.  But now you don't know, because you're going to say where you are and who you are, so it is even more uncertain.\"\nClaudia's case is in marked contrast to the images of cheering and optimistic Hispanics shown in the media after the November announcement.\nAnd her situation is far from unique. The White House has acknowledged that there is a challenge in trying to get people \"out of the shadows\", as president Obama likes to say.\nAt a town hall meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, the president stressed the need to give people confidence so they can apply.\n\"The real question is, how do we make sure enough people register so it's not just a few people in a few pockets around the country,\" Mr Obama said.\n\"And that's going to require a lot of work by local agencies, by municipalities, by churches, by community organisations.\"\nThe president is interested in getting people registered because that is how the programme's success will ultimately be measured, but also because his previous decisions on immigration have faced similar challenges.\nIn 2012, Mr Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which allowed young adults who were brought to the US illegally as children to temporarily stay and work.\nDACA was expanded as part of the November announcement, and it is seen as a blueprint for the more recent unilateral actions.\nBoth measures are limited in scope and in time, do not offer a pathway to citizenship, and were unveiled by President Obama without support by Congress.\nAround 1.1 million unauthorised immigrants were thought to be immediately eligible for DACA, and slightly over 700,000 have had their applications accepted for review, according to data analysed by the Pew Research Center in December.\nThis means that nearly two-thirds of eligible candidates have submitted their personal information, but tens of thousands have not been able to change their status.\nMany may be unaware of the programme, do not know they meet the criteria, or have had application problems.  But it is the fear of deportation that may have played a role as well for those who have decided not to come forward.\nNow, with the new executive action, the Obama administration hopes many immigrants will provide their personal details, and it is confident the initiative will not be overturned when a new president comes to the White House in 2017.\n\"Every time a US president has created a new immigration programme, it has been respected by other presidents,\" said Leon Rodriguez, the head of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\"If you qualify for the deferred action programmes, this means you are not a priority for deportation,\" he added.\nFor undocumented Hispanics like Claudia, though, there is still deep uncertainty as the plan starts to be implemented and she prepares to present all her documents.\n\"There is fear, but this action is everything we have, it's all we can hold on to,\" she admits.","summary":"President Barack Obama is already facing strong and very vocal opposition in Congress to his recent immigration overhaul, but he will also have to confront a more silent enemy.","id":"30646945"}

He may, like others who have been held at Guantanamo, be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.\nWhile the PM has said Mr Aamer won't be detained, it's unlikely we will ever find out if MI5 separately decides to monitor him - by definition its work is secret.\nMr Aamer is said to be relaxed about such prospects and has asked his lawyers to make clear he believes he has a \"contract\" to honour with the people of Britain.

They say he made false confessions to end his torture.\nIn February 2002, Mr Aamer was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where his lawyers say he suffered further abuse.\nThe US Department of Defense said on Friday a review had been conducted of Mr Aamer's case.\n\"As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, Aamer was unanimously approved for transfer.\" the statement said.\nSome 112 people are still being held at Guantanamo, which President Obama has promised to close, the statement confirmed.\nGuantanamo Bay is a US military prison in Cuba, set up during the \"war on terror\" in 2002 to detain what the US government called \"enemy combatants\".\nThe first 20 detainees were transferred to the facility on 11 January of that year, and a total of 780 men have been held since then - the vast majority without charge or criminal trial.","summary":"The last British resident to be held in Guantanamo Bay has landed in the UK, having been detained for 13 years.","id":"34675324"}

{"document":"The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says the 16 million fares currently on offer are \"baffling\" for passengers.\nIt wants to ensure passengers are offered the cheapest possible fares.\nThe trial, starting from May, will initially benefit people travelling between Scotland and south-west England.\nA traveller buying an off-peak return from Wick, in northern Scotland, to Par, in Cornwall, can currently pay up to Â£342.50, although in practice few people pay that amount.\nHowever, by buying six separate fares for each leg of the journey, passengers can pay as little as Â£80 for the same trip.\nThat would involve buying tickets from Wick to Inverness, Inverness to Edinburgh and Edinburgh to Par.\nThe RDG says the potential saving of Â£262 will soon be offered to customers automatically.\nCrossCountry Trains, the main operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well.\nPassengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh on Virgin Trains, will also benefit from clearer pricing.\nOperators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities, which is regulated by the government.\nBut the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if single fares were regulated instead.\nIt wants more booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet.\nTicket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available.\n\"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines,\" said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience.\nThe trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense.\nBen Morris, business reporter\nIn the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis.\nBut in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs).\nThe Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full.\nTo protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares.\nThe result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions.\nSavvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.\nToday's scheme aims to make those savings available to everyone.\nAt the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer.\nSuch fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail.\nNews of the trial was welcomed by passenger groups.\n\"What's clear from our research is that passengers find the ticketing system far too complex,\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus.\n\"The presence of cheaper fares that are 'hidden' in the system really damages trust between passengers and train companies.\"\nHowever Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said more needed to be done.\n\"It's quite simple. When you book a rail ticket, whether it's in a station or online, people should be given the cheapest price available at that time for their chosen journey.\n\"These changes will not make that happen. While it is certainly a move in the right direction, people cannot have the confidence that if they book a ticket, they will be paying the best price,\" he said.\nThe price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year.\nThe rise led to protests by passengers and rail unions.","summary":"Passengers using cross-country train routes could save up to Â£260 a journey, under a trial scheme to simplify fares.","id":"38812175"}

And its future beyond the end of Hockenheim's current contract in 2018 is uncertain to say the least.\nThe German GP used to be overrun with fans - and not just in the Michael Schumacher era; way before then, too, going back decades, from the golden days of the old Nurburgring and its 14 unbelievable miles and 180-odd corners through the Eiffel forests, and into the Hockenheim era.\nNow, though, the race seems to have lost its appeal.\nThe last time it was held, in 2014, only 50,000 or so fans turned up - and Hockenheim's atmospheric concrete 'stadium' section, which used to be packed, was dotted with gaps.\nThis year, organisers are hopeful of reaching the 60,000 they need to break even. But that's still less than half the numbers who thronged Silverstone for the British Grand Prix earlier this month.\nIs it down to seven-time champion Schumacher's absence? If so, what did the German fans find so alluring about him that they do not now about four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, title challenger Nico Rosberg and a dominant home Mercedes team?\nIs it part of the perceived general decline of F1's appeal to younger audiences? If so, why are crowds going up at Silverstone, and staying strong at other historic venues, such as Italy, Canada and Brazil? And why are German TV figures rising, not declining?\nOr is it that Hockenheim has had it character largely removed, with its long, flat-out blasts out into spooky pine forest replaced by yet another characterless 'Tilke-drome' from Bernie Ecclestone's favoured track architect?\nIt's not a completely terrible race track. The long, curving straight between Turns Two and Six provides for decent overtaking opportunities, there are a couple of demanding fast corners and the racing is usually OK, sometimes very good.\nBut it lacks spirit, challenge, jeopardy and, most of all, a sense of specialness - a reason to be excited. Just as, to a lesser extent, did Magny-Cours before the French Grand Prix - the oldest race of all - dropped off the calendar after 2008.\nIs Germany going the same way? One has to hope not.

{"document":"House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes is now himself under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\nThe panel is looking into claims that the Republican disclosed classified intelligence.\nMr Nunes called the charges \"entirely false\" and \"politically motivated\".\nHe said his decision to step aside came after \"several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics\".\nMr Nunes added he would continue to fulfil his other responsibilities as chairman, requesting to speak to the ethics panel \"in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims\".\nDemocrats have criticised Mr Nunes for his handling of the inquiry, which is also looking at possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\nThe House Ethics Committee said in a statement on Thursday: \"The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Devin Nunes may have made unauthorised disclosures of classified information, in violation of House rules, laws, regulations, or other standards of conduct.\"\nWatchdog groups Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington had asked the House ethics panel to investigate Mr Nunes.\nHis political foes have accused him of helping the White House to divert attention from several investigations into links between the Trump team and Russian officials.\nMr Nunes has acknowledged making an after-dark trip to the White House grounds last month that even the congressman's own aides were apparently unaware of.\nThe next day at a hastily arranged news conference he announced he had learned that post-election communications of Mr Trump's team had been monitored by US intelligence agencies as they snooped on foreign officials.\nHe expressed alarm that information about the then-incoming president's aides had been swept up in US intelligence reports.\nMr Nunes' Democratic colleagues on the panel were furious that he had not shared such information with them before going public.\nIn the face of much scepticism, Mr Nunes maintains White House officials were not his original source for the claims.\nDemocrats questioned whether the investigation into Russia's alleged role in the election could proceed objectively.\nIt's never a good sign when the investigator becomes a bigger story than the investigation.\nSuch was the case with Congressman Devin Nunes, with his shifting explanations for where and how he acquired sensitive intelligence documents, his decision to keep details from his fellow intelligence committee members, his apparent behind-the-scenes co-ordination with White House sources and his penchant for dramatic press conferences.\nAll this made him a liability for Republican congressional leadership and the White House. Now he is, at least temporarily, out of the picture.\nHe may blame an ethics complaint filed by \"leftwing activist groups\" for forcing the move, but there's little doubt that many Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief. Mr Nunes, at times, seemed out of his depth on the big political stage.\nThe committee's investigations effectively had been ground to a halt by partisan bickering, and this move is a first step toward rebooting the efforts.\nIt may be too late, however, as the concurrent Senate intelligence committee investigation has launched more smoothly and with a greater show of bipartisan co-operation.\nMembers of the House of Representatives often complain of being viewed as the \"baby brother\" to the upper chamber. The dual Russia probes haven't done much to dispel that notion.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said he fully supported Mr Nunes' decision.\nMr Ryan said he trusts Mr Nunes, but the ehtics inquiry \"would be a distraction\" for the House Intelligence Committee investigation.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he respected Mr Nunes' decision.\n\"We have a fresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands,\" he added.\nA White House spokesman said in response to the announcement: \"This is an internal matter for the House\".\nTexas Representative Mike Conaway will take over that inquiry with the help of fellow Republicans Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney.\n\"We're going to proceed with the investigation and follow every lead to its logical conclusion,\" Mr Conaway said on Thursday.\nIt is unclear whether Mr Nunes' departure will end the partisan bickering that has brought the committee's investigation to a virtual halt.\nBut a separate Senate Intelligence Committee probe into Russia's alleged role in the US election appeared to be moving forward, conducting its first round of hearings on the issue last week.\nMeanwhile, the FBI also recently acknowledged it is running its own probe into claims of Kremlin political meddling.\nMr Nunes said he plans to return to the House investigation, but he did not provide a timeline.","summary":"The head of a key US congressional investigation into alleged Russian hacking has temporarily stepped down amid an ethics inquiry into him.","id":"39515098"}

{"document":"Members of the exporters' group Opec, together with some other oil producers, are meeting in Qatar on Sunday to discuss freezing output.\nThey want to push up the price of crude oil, which is less than half what it was in June 2014\nIn previous episodes of falling prices, Opec has been much quicker to respond, often cutting output.\nThe agenda for the meeting in Doha, the capital of Qatar, is a freeze in production. No cuts in other words, just a commitment to no more increases.\nBut even that possibility has given some support in recent weeks to the price of oil. The low it reached earlier this year was about $27 a barrel for Brent crude oil, one of the leading international market prices.\nThis week it has been very close to $45. That is to a large extent due to traders considering the possibility that some oil producers are close to taking some sort of action to push prices higher.\nIt's worth emphasising that even at current levels the price of oil is far below where it was as recently as June 2014 - when it reached $115.\nThe fall has hurt many oil producing countries. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said it had damaged financial stability and the government finances in many of them.\nThe meeting is not formally an Opec event, though all or very nearly all the group's members will be represented.  There will also be some non-members, notably Russia.\nThe decision to hold this meeting, with a rather unusual group of attendees, reflects the oil exporters' persistent concerns about the level of prices and a feeling that any action needs to involve more than just the members of Opec.\nTwo of the world's leading producers are not going to be there: the US and China.  Both countries have large oil production industries, but they use nearly all of it themselves, and have to import extra to meet their own needs. Their economies overall tend to benefit from cheaper oil so they don't have a shared interest with those who will be turning up in Doha.\nStill, there is more than enough oil production that will be represented there to make a substantial difference to the global market if the participants chose to take strong action.\nWhat many oil analysts say, however, is that they aren't talking about action that is going to achieve much. In the past, Opec has often managed to agree and deliver cuts in production. This time all that's on the table is a potential agreement to refrain from further increases.\nAmong the countries attending there is certainly a good deal of support for the idea. But one important player, an Opec member, is determined to increase its production: Iran.\nAs the country emerges from western sanctions, the Iranian government wants to regain the share of the market that it lost as a result of those restrictions on its international sales.\nIran is not even sending its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh to the meeting, although another senior official is expected to attend.\nSaudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince has said that a freeze could only happen if Iran takes part. But there are doubts about whether this really is the Kingdom's last word.\nSaudi concerns are the key reason why countries outside Opec are involved.  Whenever Opec has cut production in the past, Saudi Arabia has tended to make the biggest contribution. But this time, they were reluctant to take the loss of market share that would involve.  But it's less of a sacrifice if some other countries take part. The US never would, so Russia is the biggest producer that could be involved.\nSo if they can agree a freeze, would it make much difference? London consultancy Capital Economics said in a note to clients: \"Freezing output at current high levels would simply maintain the excess supply that is now in place and as such would not be a game changer.\"\nPerhaps what would make more difference is the much anticipated decline in American shale oil production which appears to be finally gathering pace, according to the International Energy Agency, an official organisation which monitors the energy situation for its member countries.\nIn fact one reason for Saudi Arabia's reluctance to take action sooner is widely thought to have been a desire to keep the pressure on its competitors in the US shale business.\nIt's worth remembering that the rise of shale oil in the US has transformed the global market. The increased US supply is one of the key factors that have been bearing down on international oil prices, along with weakness of demand which in turn reflects China's economic slowdown and the failure of the global economy to generate robust growth.\nHaving said all that, this meeting might turn out to have some symbolic significance. Opec has been very slow to respond to what is a serious problem for its members.  Most recently when the group met in December last year, their final statement surprised many observers when it did not even mention a production ceiling, something they nearly always set out at their regular meetings. .\nAnalysts at Barclays Research said ahead of the Doha event: \"Opec's December meeting was a failure, but Doha gives the organisation the opportunity to reassert its relevance.\"","summary":"The world's leading oil exporters could be finally about to take action following the fall in prices.","id":"36040711"}

{"document":"Brent and US crude futures fell below $45 and $40 a barrel respectively as global investors assessed the contagion risks of China's volatile stock market.\nRecent data has suggested that China's economic growth continues to slow down.\nAs well as the volatility in Chinese shares, there are fears of a protracted effect on demand for commodities.\nChina's slowdown is expected to pull down other regional economies, affecting energy and raw material consumption.\nThe unstable Chinese market has also led to worries that the problems in the world's second largest economy may have far-reaching global consequences.\nChina's benchmark Shanghai Composite index on Monday shed as much as 8%, while markets in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney all dropped by more than 4%.\nOn Friday, figures showed China's factory activity in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years.\nOfficial figures have indicated that China's economic growth is continuing to slow. For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009.\nBernard Aw, market strategist with trading firm IG, said given the tepid demand, it was hard to fathom why oil producers were pumping out more crude.\nOpec producers, notably Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were producing more oil than necessary, while US stockpiles were nearly 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average.\n\"At this rate, the fundamentals of oil are going to get worse before it gets better as the supply glut widens.

{"document":"Once they had been some of the most powerful men in Libya, with the power of life and death over their fellow citizens.\nNow they just looked old and diminished, and some looked ill. One former minister (he was later found not guilty) seemed to be suffering from advanced senility.\nThe most powerful of them all, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, was absent, as he had been for the entire trial. Col Gaddafi's son was locked in a prison nearly a 100 miles away.\nIt was hard to think that these men once inspired such terror. None of them seemed cocky or aggressive as they waited to hear what their punishment would be.\nThey sat quietly, some making nervous movements of their hands, one or two grasping the bars of the cage, others playing with imaginary worry-beads. One kept his eyes shut, moving gently backwards and forwards, muttering to himself.\nWhen the sentences were read out, though, their faces didn't register much emotion - though one man winced as he heard what would happen to him:  life imprisonment.\nOne prisoner, overweight and tough-looking, suddenly collapsed. Leaning against the man next to him, his face turned a blueish-grey and his eyes sightless. It looked like a stroke or a heart-attack, but it turned out to be a powerful asthma attack brought on by the stress of the sentencing.\nThe presiding judge rarely glanced at the men in the dock; he must have seen them all so often during the past three years. He ran through the long list quickly and fluently.\nEven when the lights went out - in Tripoli, the electricity supply is constantly being cut - he continued reading aloud with scarcely a beat missed, using the emergency red lights around his microphone.\nNo one could forget, though, that the star of the show was missing.  Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's sentence - death by shooting - was the first to be announced, and a little quiver ran around the court-room as it was. He may have been watching the proceedings in his prison in the centre of Zintan, in the western mountains. If so, he won't have been surprised.\nBy the last years of the Gaddafi regime Saif al-Islam was deeply loathed in Libya, even while politicians in Britain, France and Italy were behaving as though he was a close friend. His dubious PhD from the London School of Economics was regarded in Tripoli with scorn.\nYet he continued to lecture the nation on television, much as he lectured anyone who - like me - interviewed him, waving his forefinger in everyone's face.\nAt first, when the men from the Zintan group captured Saif al-Islam Gaddafi after the fall of his father in 2011, some of them treated him brutally.\nThey chopped off the admonitory forefinger, and, cradling his hand in a bloodstained handkerchief, he pretended his hand had been injured in a Western air strike.\nA year or so later, some of his self-confidence had returned.  In 2013, when I went to Zintan to watch him make an appearance in court, he greeted me with a little of the old cheerfulness, glad perhaps to have a television camera to play up to again.\nIs he now in danger of execution? His lawyers will no doubt appeal against his sentence, as those representing most or all of the other eight people condemned to death will do.\nBut Saif al-Islam's best protection is probably the fact that he's being held in Zintan. He's hated there as much as anywhere - the incident of the forefinger shows that - but the huge antagonism which exists between the Zintan group and the Tripoli government makes it highly unlikely that the Zintanis will hand him over now.\nThe relationship between Zintan and the predominantly Muslim Brotherhood government in Tripoli is so bitter that it will probably be the greatest factor in deciding Saif al-Islam's fate.\nWas his trial, and that of the other members of the Gaddafi regime, a fair one? It was certainly more than a little chaotic, but that is only to be expected. To an outsider, it doesn't look like victors' revenge: the results are much more considered and varied than that. Four defendants were acquitted, including a former foreign minister.\nThe view of the International Criminal Court is that The Hague is the proper place to hold trials like this. Most Libyans would probably say that it's essential for them as a nation to sort out their own problems, by themselves.\nWhat eventually happens to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and the others sentenced to death will colour the way the outside world regards Libya in future. Life imprisonment will scarcely get any attention internationally; execution will attract the kind of criticism that Libya could well do without.","summary":"The accused men sat behind the bars of their cage in blue prison-issue pyjamas, their heads close-cropped.","id":"33698053"}

{"document":"Only time will tell whether he gets his wish.\nNo-one should get too carried away, though.\nBritain has had only a handful of non-white cabinet ministers. Indeed, Mr Cameron's new cabinet, following his election victory in May, has just two minority-ethnic cabinet ministers.\nIt is all a far cry from 1987, when four new black and minority-ethnic MPs - all Labour - entered the House, a symbolic and powerful moment for many observers.\nPaul Boateng had the most successful ministerial career, eventually making it into the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury.\nMuch of the commentary focused on his being the first black cabinet minister and some speculated that he might rise to the very top. It was not to be. He now sits in the Lords.\nKeith Vaz rose to become the first Asian minister in the Commons in 1999.\nMr Vaz's newsworthy quotes keep him in the public eye as the long-serving chairman of the home affairs select committee.\nDiane Abbott has a big political and media profile but has stayed on the back benches, as did Bernie Grant, before his premature death.\nThe Tories at that time had no real equivalent representation in terms of black and minority-ethnic MPs.\nThere was a lingering suspicion that the majority of voters from these communities didn't like the Conservatives.\nThere was a damaging public row when a black candidate, John Taylor, was selected to fight Cheltenham in 1992. There was opposition from the local association and the campaign itself was marred by racist jibes. Taylor lost.\nIt was the Blair-Brown years that changed the landscape at ministerial level.\nThe Tottenham MP, David Lammy, was one early star. He rose quickly and, having been elected at just 27, he was immediately weighed down by the \"Britain's next black prime minister\" label.\nHe didn't last but he has reinvented himself as a vocal backbencher and is in the mix to be Labour's choice for London mayor.\nBaroness Scotland, the first ethnic minority attorney general, was another prominent appointment. Then there was Shahid Malik, who became Britain's first Muslim minister in 2007.\nWhen David Cameron came to power in 2010, he brought in Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. She was the first Muslim woman cabinet minister.\nHer star burned brightly for a short time but she is no longer in government. Instead, she has carved a role as a critical voice, particularly on relations with the Muslim community.\nAnother casualty was Shailesh Vara, who lost his post as a government whip. He is currently parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Justice. and remains influential in Tory attempts to appeal to the British Asian community.\nThe Liberal Democrats, now a crushed force in Westminster, did not have a single non-white MP in the 2010-15 Parliament.\nThe twists and turns of political life make predictions difficult.  The  Business Secretary Sajid Javid is seen by some as a future leader. His ethnicity - the son of an immigrant from Pakistan - is of less interest than his political views, perhaps another sign of a gradual shift in perceptions.\nPriti Patel in the employment portfolio is another rising star - she became the first female minister of Indian descent last month.\nJavid and Patel would once have been that rare breed - minority-ethnic Westminster politicians with right-wing views. No longer. Patel's beliefs on welfare reform attract more interest than her ethnicity.\nOn the Labour side, Chuka Ummuna was seen by many as the leading candidate to be the new Labour leader - until his withdrawal from the race. He entered Parliament just five years ago but is already a senior Labour figure and a regular on TV.\nSadiq Khan is another example of a big and influential Westminster politician, experienced in shadowing ministers, and now hoping to run for London mayor.\nThe new House of Commons has a record number of non-white MPs, who make up about 6% of the new Parliament, up from just over 4% in 2010.\nCritics say this is encouraging but goes nowhere near far enough if Parliament is to truly represent all of the population.","summary":"David Cameron said in a speech last November that he wanted to see an ethnic minority prime minister to prove \"Britons of all backgrounds can achieve\".","id":"33162298"}

{"document":"What is the row about?\nHindus and Muslims have been at loggerheads for more than a century over the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nHindus claim the mosque was the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram, and that it was built after the destruction of a Hindu temple by a Muslim invader in the 16th Century.\nMuslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949, when some people placed the idols of Ram under the cover of darkness in the mosque. The worship of the idols began soon after.\nOver the next four decades, Hindu and Muslim groups went to court over the control of the site and the right to offer prayers there.\nThe dispute erupted in 1992 when a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque, and nearly 2,000 people were killed in subsequent religious riots across the country.\nWhat do the courts say about the row?\nAllahabad High Court's ruling in September 2010 addressed three questions. It said that the disputed spot was Ram's birthplace, that the mosque was built after the demolition of a temple and that it was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.\nFollowing the decision, Hindus hope to see a temple built on the site, while Muslims are still demanding the reconstruction of the mosque.\nIn 2011 the Supreme Court suspended the ruling after Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against the 2010 verdict.\nThe case has already languished in India's famously sluggish legal system for so long that most of the original petitioners have died.\nWho was awarded what?\nThe court ruled in an 8,500-page judgement that two-thirds of the disputed site should be allocated to Hindu groups, with the remainder to Muslims.\nFor the first time in a judicial ruling, it said that the disputed site was the birthplace of the Hindu god.\nThe court ordered that the current arrangement at Ayodhya - which is currently the site of a makeshift Hindu temple - should be \"maintained as the status quo\" for three months to allow time for any appeals against the judgement.\nHow did the judges rule on the conflicting claims?\nThe court ruled that the disputed site is the birth place of Lord Ram, who is \"both a juristic person and a deity\".\nThe two Hindu judges on the three-judge panel said that the building constructed by the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, Babur, was not a mosque because it was built \"against the tenets of Islam\" on the site of a demolished Hindu temple.\nHowever the Muslim judge in the case dissented from this view, arguing that no temple had been destroyed and that the mosque was built on ruins.\nThe two Hindu judges also agreed that the Ayodhya site was found by the Archaeological Survey of India originally to have been \"a massive Hindu religious structure\" and that Hindus had been worshipping there as a \"sacred place of pilgrimage... since time immemorial\".\nIt also ruled that Hindu idols were placed in the disputed structure in 1949 - a point which Muslims argue is important because that act, they say, triggered much of the tension over Ayodhya that remains today.\nWhen did Hindu-Muslim tensions last escalate?\nMore than 50 people died in February 2002 when a train carrying Hindu activists returning to Gujarat from Ayodhya was set alight, allegedly by a Muslim mob.\nAt least 1,000 people - mainly Muslims - died in the violence in the state that erupted afterwards. Other estimates say the death toll was at least double that.\nHave religious tensions eased in India in recent years?\nYes. It is now not as easy to mobilise young people under the banner of religion as it was in the early 1990s.\nIndia's economic boom has changed priorities, and development is now the key issue. Correspondents say in recent years Hindu extremists have failed to win the supporters that many feared they would in 1992.","summary":"BBC News examines key questions surrounding the bitter dispute over the flashpoint religious site at Ayodhya in northern India - in 1992 it prompted some of the country's worst religious violence since partition.","id":"11435240"}

{"document":"An all-rounder with no forearms, a batsman who rarely leaves his home and the youngster who has had his life transformed by cricket. BBC Kick Off reporter Josef Rindl met the Warwickshire disability cricket team preparing to take on England.\n\"Boot it,\" shouts 18-year-old Joe Glaze, as a broad smile stretches across his face before what is just his third match for Warwickshire Super9's disability cricket team.\nAfter facing Derbyshire, his next could be against England's physical disability team at home in the Midlands on Sunday, 30 July.\nGlaze was only introduced to the game three months earlier, having attended a cricket festival at his special needs school. He suffers from a rare genetic disorder and is also on the autistic spectrum.\nJoe's father, Andy, has quickly got involved as an assistant coach and is an avid photographer from the sidelines.\n\"Sport teaches you life skills,\" Andy told BBC Sport. \"It teaches you teamwork, discipline, but most importantly social skills. It is all ideal for someone like Joe.\"\nGlaze runs towards his father and screams excitedly: \"10, 10, Dad I'm batting at 10.\"\n\"Three months ago he couldn't hold a bat,\" Andy recalled. \"Now he's the only batsman I've seen who runs from the clubhouse to the crease.\"\nRecounting the first time his son picked up the bat, Andy continued: \"We were in a school sports hall and he hit the ball down the length of the hall and through an open corridor - it remains one of my happiest moments in cricket.\n\"I just had to get involved. For the kids here, (the Super9's) is brilliant.\"\nFor some, the match against Derbyshire represented their last chance to impress ahead of England's visit, with two players in the squad on the fringes of national selection.\nCharlie Pestridge, the captain, is one of them. He is a batsman, a bowler and against Derbyshire, because nobody else is available, a stand-in wicketkeeper.\nPestridge, who has cerebral palsy, said it took him about six months to even find a disability team.\n\"It's that hidden,\" he said. \"I'm glad I discovered the team. It's great to be able to see people play who wouldn't usually have been given a chance.\"\nThe match, played at the picturesque Alcester and Ragley Cricket Club, has all the hallmarks of the traditional village cricket game; cars parked around the boundary, spectators construct a gazebo and small children hide under the mobile covers.\nPestridge, 20, is now on the cusp of the national team, regularly attending a training centre in Northampton.\nHe hopes to earn England selection for next year's tri-series tournament against Australia and South Africa.\nTo do so, Pestridge has to juggle a busy schedule. He studies mathematics at Bath University and featuring for Warwickshire in their Midlands Group game against Derbyshire means an 180-mile round trip.\n\"Right now I'm not sure whether to prioritise the degree or aim towards representing my country,\" he admitted.\n\"I'd love to play for England.\"\nThere are three England disability sides, representing the visually impaired, learning and physical disabilities.\nBoth the learning and physical disability teams play tri-series against Australia and South Africa in alternate years, with the learning disability side winning the latest series in July.\nWithout international fixtures this summer, England's physical disability team is touring on home soil, playing eight different teams including three academy sides and a select Army XI.\nJuly is their busiest month, with four tour dates culminating with two T20 fixtures against Warwickshire.\n\"It will be fantastic,\" said coach Andy Wyles, who led Warwickshire Super9's to their maiden Championship title in 2005. \"How many of this team a year ago would have thought they'd play against England?\"\nThere is a constant buzz of chit-chat among the Warwickshire players, so much so that one player, Tarac Sarwar, was given two warnings by the umpire for talking during the bowlers' run-up.\nHe also got so carried away whilst batting at the non-striker's end that he appealed against his own team-mate.\nHis nickname is \"chatterbox\", and at the age of 48 he is a transformed man.\nSarwar is among the oldest in the team and the only time he left his house in the three weeks leading up to the match was to train.\n\"At my home I'm in my own world,\" he says. \"I spend most of my time watching cartoons, never the news. That just reminds me of my own problems.\"\nSarwar has autism, dyslexia, has regular panic attacks and sometimes epileptic fits.\nFind out how to get into disability sport with our special guide.\nHe continued: \"In my day people did not understand dyslexia. They would rather say 'I wasn't learning anything because I was a troublemaker', not because I didn't know how to read or write.\n\"The way they teach now is so much better.\"\nSarwar rarely left his home until after his 18th birthday. When he did go outdoors, he would go only to the local chip shop and sit there for two hours.\n\"I didn't have any friends; I had nowhere else to go,\" he said.\nBut cricket has had a profound effect on Sarwar, opening up new opportunities for social interaction and even employment.\n\"I don't know where I'd be without the team,\" said Sarwar, who works at a special school in Birmingham and is a disability cricket coach at his local club.\n\"I only want to help people, and working at a disability school is so rewarding.\"\nWarwickshire is a team in which all the players are striving to achieve something unique to them.\nFor some, it is about learning how to play that sweet straight drive or expanding their personal horizons, while for others it is a stepping stone to international stage.\nKearan Gibbs, 17, has been called up to play for the England Physical Disability Lions, essentially the under-21s.\nBorn without forearms, Gibbs bowls off-spin without any artificial aids by gripping the ball in the fold of his arms.\nHe first shot to prominence and become one of \"the faces of English disability cricket\" when, in 2011, practice facilities were installed in his garden by a charity.\nNews reports of the gesture went global.\nDespite his youth, Gibbs is now one of the most experienced players in the side, having turned out for Warwickshire and Northants as well as making the Super9's final with Somerset in 2012.\nTheir match against England will be another chance for Gibbs to impress national selectors at a senior level.\n\"It will be competitive but I'm not too bothered. I just want to help the guys,\" he said.\nAnd that is what the team represents - a chance.\n\"A big part of this is giving opportunities that wouldn't have been there in mainstream cricket or sport in general,\" coach Wyles added.","summary":"\"What you gonna do when you get into bat, Joe?\"","id":"40586630"}
{"document":"Speaking as the fate of thousands of steel jobs hangs in the balance, Lord West said that UK production was vital for the defence sector.\nHe argued that all countries that are members of the United Nations Security Council had major steel plants to support their defence industry.\n\"I cannot think of another major military power that doesn't have its own indigenous steel production capabilities,\" Lord West told the BBC.\n\"Certainly none of the members of the UN Security Council have jettisoned that capability and I find it extraordinary to think that we as a nation would do that.\"\nLord West, the former security minister in Gordon Brown's government, and now a member of Parliament's Joint Committee on National Security Strategy, said that having an indigenous capacity was vital.\n\"Steel is fundamental to industrial output,\" the Labour peer argued.\n\"It's seen as one of the key things that a nation produces.\n\"It's fundamental to the production of cars, warship building, ship building more widely and the construction industry. The nuclear power stations being built will have an awful lot of steel in them.\n\"And any nation with any clout of any significance has its own steel industry, because any nation of any clout - and we are the fifth richest in the world - [well] I'm afraid in the next 50 years there might well be people who don't like Britain in that position, and who knows what's going to happen.\n\"And it's important we have our own indigenous capability so that when push comes to shove and our backs are to the wall we can still produce things vital to ensure the survival and safety of our population.\"\nSenior figures in the defence industry have told me that steel production in the UK is \"preferable\" to sourcing supplies from abroad and that the manufacturing skills base in the UK would be undermined if the steel industry was wound down.\nSome 94% of the steel being used to build the UK's two new aircraft carriers is British made.\nBut despite the calls for support for the mass steel industry, some business leaders are urging caution when the government considers how best to react.\nSimon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, told the BBC the MG Rover debacle - when the government financially supported the retention of car production at the Longbridge plant which later collapsed - showed that large amounts of money can be wasted trying to defy economic gravity.\n\"There's always a temptation for politicians to intervene when this many jobs are concerned,\" he said.\n\"I don't think it is the right approach.\n\"There is a future for British steel but it's not about basic steel products.\n\"It's about advanced high tech products like vessels for nuclear reactors.\n\"British manufacturers consume far more steel than is produced. It's a far bigger part of that economy, and I'm afraid cheaper steel is in the interests of those industries.\n\"So my focus would be on helping the people who have been affected and retraining them, reskilling them into other kinds of jobs, because I'm afraid this just isn't the future of British manufacturing.\n\"The government poured tens of millions [of pounds] into MG Rover when that looked as if it was going to collapse in 2005 and what do you know, it did and the money was all lost.\n\"We're talking a million pounds a day that is being lost [by Tata Steel at Port Talbot].\n\"You can't just say the tax payer will pick up the tab.

{"document":"Leaked documents show that Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007.\nHe did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later.\nHe says no rules were broken and his wife did not benefit financially.\nThe offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir in 2015.\nThe leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson was granted a general power of attorney over Wintris - which gave him the power to manage the company \"without any limitation\". Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney.\nCourt records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies.\nMr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris.\nHe resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full.\nIf foreign investors had been repaid, it may have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris.\nBut Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret.\nMr Gunnlaugsson's spokesman said his policies had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants.\n\"The prime minister's wife's losses on these bonds issued by the failed banks will amount to hundreds of millions of Kronur and the scope for recoveries is extremely small.\"\nThe spokesman said Ms Palsdottir had always declared the assets to the tax authorities and that under the parliamentary rules Mr Gunnlaugsson did not have to declare an interest in Wintris.\nHe said that joint share certificates in Wintris had been issued because the prime minister and his wife had a joint bank account. This was pointed out to them when the documents were reviewed in 2009.\n\"It had always been clear to both of them that the prime minister's wife owned the assets, and this had not changed. Therefore it was immediately requested for the shareholder structure to be mended.

{"document":"First, the BBC pays below - and sometimes much below - market rates, both at management level and in terms of top broadcasting talent.\nSecond, this move will prove inflationary. Those on the list will think to themselves: \"Why is that inferior presenter getting paid more than me?\" - and will demand a pay rise.\nThird, if you thought it was tin hat time for the talent, pity the poor agents they work with.\nAll over the land talent agents are being exposed either for having exaggerated what certain people are paid - in order to get a good deal for their client - or having several clients who do similar roles but at wildly different pay. Ouch.\nIn recent weeks I have spoken to at least a dozen people in the industry, from top agents to the likes of Michael Grade (former boss of the BBC, Channel 4, and ITV - and an agent) and these points command a consensus.\nBut whenever I see a consensus, my instinct is to run in the opposite direction.\nFor all that the BBC may pay less than some rivals, the individual figures released today will shock many members of the public.\nIt is in the very nature of broadcasting that viewers and listeners develop a connection to these so-called stars.\nSome they like, some they hate; and almost all they will have an opinion on. That opinion will be fundamentally re-adjusted by their knowledge of how much these broadcasters are charging.\nNot all the numbers released today actually pertain to salaries: there are some individuals who will have been paid over ÃÂ£150,000 in the financial year up to 2016\/7, but who aren't continuing in those roles and projects in the following financial year.\nSuch details will most likely be lost in the coming days, as a few key themes emerge.\nOne is the gender gap. A third of the 96 names are women, which Tony Hall admitted to me last night isn't good enough.\nAn area that I suspect will arouse controversy is why different presenters on the same shows get different salaries.\nThere are several instances where men get paid more than women doing the same show. Of course individual circumstances vary. But this is not a good look for the BBC.\nBut as I said on Today this morning, the BBC might feel relatively happy talking about gender, because they have a decent story to tell here. Not only are over 60 per cent of recent appointments of over ÃÂ£150,000 female, but there are some really high-profile ones too. Just this weekend, the new Doctor Who was revealed to be a woman.\nMoreover, what the BBC won't want - but which is inevitable - is for this story to become a sequence of character assassinations. They'd much rather talk about gender targets than why anyone should get 20 or 50 times the average income in Britain to read the news or host a conversation on the radio.\nTomorrow's papers will be full of aggressive personal attacks, not just on Chris Evans and Gary Lineker - who are at the top of the list - but the likes of John Humphrys, Jeremy Vine, Stephen Nolan and Alan Yentob.\nAlas for the corporation, much as it would like to talk in generalities about targets on gender and diversity, the publication of these figures has in effect opened up 96 negotiations - between each individual and the public, often mediated by newspapers not very fond of the BBC, staffed by journalists who will never earn six figure sums.\nThe licence-fee payer might - and Britain's press certainly will - ask: can these hugely well paid stars really get equivalent money elsewhere?\nProbably not. And so if, say, this or that radio presenter would do the same job for ÃÂ£100,000 less, why the hell shouldn't he or she take a pay cut?\nThese individual negotiations between on-air talent, the public and other media will dominate the story in the medium-term.\nTony Hall and his fellow negotiators didn't want this information in the public domain, arguing it would amount to a poachers' charter. That was a bullish claim. We are about to find out if the BBC was right to make it.","summary":"If you ask experienced people in the world of broadcasting what they think of these salary disclosures, three clear and consistent points are apparent.","id":"40655573"}

{"document":"I knew I wanted to get involved in Red Nose Day this year. But then I decided to take it one step further.\nI'd wanted to go on a Comic Relief trip for years and here was the perfect opportunity, so I agreed to take my first ever trip to Liberia in West Africa.\nDuring the trip, we visited a school in West Point, the largest and most dangerous slum in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.\nIt was really shocking seeing the appalling conditions that people live in and it was far worse than I could have ever imagined.\nNothing could have prepared me for what I saw, but despite all of this, everyone's positivity was overwhelming.\nThe welcome from the kids was amazing, especially when they saw my tattoos; they went nuts and couldn't understand what they were.\nSome of the younger kids tried to wipe them off. Everyone wanted to know what we were doing and where we were from.\nThey absolutely loved singing and clapping along to my songs and for a few hours it was easy to forget that these kids live in such awful conditions.\nI was completely blown away by their eagerness to learn. They really wanted to be in school and all had big dreams for the future.\nDespite living in one of the poorest places on Earth, they weren't prepared to let their circumstances hold them back.\nI asked a lot of them what they wanted to be when they grow up and \"doctor\", \"teacher\" and \"politician\" were common responses. I got a sense that they really meant it.\nThey've seen what life is like for people with no qualifications or jobs and it's the motivation they need to keep studying.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of people crammed in to West Point, most of them living in squalor, so getting an education is a privilege and not something all of the kids get to do.\nAs we were taking a break from filming, a little girl came over to talk to me. Her name was Peaches and unlike the other children I'd met, she wasn't in a uniform.\nShe explained that since her father's death during the Ebola crisis, her mother couldn't afford to send her to school any more.\nAt just 12 years old, she had already been working for over a year helping to support her family. Unfortunately, Peaches' story is not uncommon.\nWe had an impromptu jamming session and the girl could really sing. Peaches sang a song that reminded her of her father and as she did, tears started to roll down her face.\nThe enthusiasm that was initially shining out of her disappeared.\nIt was at this point that the reality of Peaches' situation, and many, many kids just like her, hit me really hard.\nPeaches told me she wanted to be a musician when she grows up, and who knows, maybe she can make that happen, but for now, she has been forced to drop out of school and spends her days working in a filthy, dangerous slum, earning what she can to help feed her family.\nIt is because of kids like Peaches and the thousands more like her across Africa that I am relieved that Red Nose Day exists.\nWest Point is like a forgotten world, shut away from the rest of the civilisation, yet the money you raise in the UK is helping the kids that live there.\nSo many of them don't have a childhood the way you or I would recognise it: they struggle every day just to survive.\nDuring my trip I got to visit a project that's using Comic Relief cash to help abandoned children and those not in school across Liberia.\nBecause of public donations, many children will be able to go back to school and get an education. For a lot of them this is their only chance of a better future and a life outside of the slum.\nI've no doubt that with the right opportunities Peaches absolutely could be a singer, or a teacher, or she could very well end up running the country.\nJust a small amount of money can make such a big difference in a place like West Point and at least gives these kids a fighting chance. I know this because I've seen it with my own eyes.\nJust ÃÂ£45 could be life-changing to someone like Peaches, it could pay for a child in Liberia to go to school for a whole year.\nI really hope the money we raise this Red Nose Day can help thousands of children, just like Peaches, to follow their dreams.\nRed Nose Day 2017 airs at 19:00 GMT on BBC One on Friday, and will show more from Ed's trip to Liberia.

{"document":"Scotland was classed as \"average\" for the first time in a major international study of education.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government is carrying out a major review of school governance.\nSo just how are schools and the education system run at the moment?\nIn a nutshell, there is a national school system in Scotland which councils are responsible for delivering.\nSchool buildings are the responsibility of councils - they decide how many schools are needed and where they should be built, open or closed, although they have to observe national rules and guidance.\nThe system for closing rural schools was overhauled a few years ago. The government also helps fund some new school buildings through its Schools for the Future programme.\nCouncils also employ teachers and decide how many there should be. However the Scottish government took steps to reverse the long-term decline in teacher numbers across Scotland.\nThis year, teacher numbers were maintained or rose in 20 of Scotland's 32 council areas.\nThe most recent funding deal with local government made it plain that the government expected the ratio of teachers to pupils to be maintained. This happened in all but 12 areas.\nHowever, councils are currently responsible for deciding just how much to spend on schools overall - this could be set to change.\nThe government intends to hold a consultation a \"national funding formula\" for schools. It also plans to give ÃÂ£100m straight to head teachers from next year.\nThis all fits into a bigger debate about school governance. The question is over just what powers individual head teachers should have, what powers councils should retain and what powers should be given to planned new regional education boards which will work across council boundaries.\nThe consultation closes on 6 January.\nTwo national agencies also have important responsibilities - the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Education Scotland.\nThe SQA is, by far, the better known to the public. Because of its profile, its staff can sometimes feel they are being blamed by headline writers and critics for things which it cannot reasonably be held to account for.\nThe main role of the SQA is to set exams and mark them. It took the organisation years to recover its public reputation after a debacle in 2000 when thousands of youngsters received the wrong exam results.\nThe SQA is also responsible for some of the paperwork which teachers may find frustrating - but some \"SQA-related workload\" is not actually the direct responsibility of the authority.\nThe unit assessments that currently form mandatory parts of courses, and the Added Value Units candidates some National 5 candidates complete so they can get a lower qualification if they fail the exam, have been cited by critics.\nBut was the issue the assessments and units themselves, or how they were sometimes being used locally?\nDecisions on how many qualifications youngsters should routinely be allowed to study for have been taken by individual schools and councils.\nSome concerns about workload came about because S4 students at some schools were being given the opportunity to study for seven or eight qualifications although six is more common.\nDecisions on whether or not to make all students complete Added Value Units were taken too by individual schools or councils.\nSome teachers would contend that only students who were at risk of failing the exam should do them - putting all students through them, they argued, was a waste of time for all concerned.\nThe Scottish government recently announced that mandatory unit assessments - assessments which students had to complete before sitting exams - were being scrapped.\nProblems with the quality of the exam papers - for example with this year's National 5 computing exam and last year's Higher Maths - are issues which the SQA can be held to account for.\nHowever, the SQA is not responsible for what should be in the curriculum itself.\nThe design of the curriculum is carried out by Education Scotland, which also provides curriculum guidance and produces material that teachers may want to use in their lessons.\nEducation Scotland is also responsible for carrying out school inspections and writing reports on them.\nCritics claim the agency should be split up and different organisations should carry out its two distinct functions\nCouncils, the Scottish government, the SQA and Education Scotland all have important - and sometimes related - responsibilities.\nSometimes the exact demarcation lines may not always be obvious - a critic may want to ask whether there is a perceived problem with the system itself, a particular agency or how the system is being implemented locally?","summary":"The political debate around education has intensified in recent weeks.","id":"38317208"}

US officials say the base was used to launch a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians on Tuesday.\nAccording to Idlib's opposition-run health authority, 89 people, including 33 children and 18 women, died in the suspected nerve agent attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. Syria denies using nerve gas.\nMs Haley told an emergency session of the UN Security Council that America had acted to ensure Syrian President Bashar al-President Assad would never use chemical weapons again.\n\"We are prepared to do more but we hope that will not be necessary,\" she said. \"It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.\"\nShe blamed Iran and Russia for standing by the Syrian government when it committed crimes. \"Strengthening Assad will only lead to more murders,\" she said.\nRussia's deputy ambassador to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, described the US strikes as \"illegitimate\".\n\"When you take your own path, this leads to horrible tragedies in the region,\" he told the Americans.\nUK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the strikes were a \"proportionate response to unspeakable acts\".\nCruise missiles fly low and have a relatively small radar cross-section so they are difficult to destroy with air defences. Russia may seek to improve Syria's surface-to-air missile system in the wake of this US attack but it would be very much a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.\nSyria used to have a highly effective national air defence system based on Soviet-era radars and missiles but it has been significantly weakened in the wake of the civil war and the loss of territory by the regime. Look at the ease with which the Israelis carry out strikes against Hezbollah arms convoys and weapons stores in Syria.\nRussia has some of its most modern surface-to-air missile systems at its air base in Syria and radars with a huge reach but, for whatever reason, they too have not deterred Israeli strikes.\nTheir presence makes air strikes by manned US aircraft unlikely and for Washington the Tomahawk cruise missile will remain the weapon of choice\nTwo US Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Shayrat airfield in western Homs province at about 04:40 Syrian time (01:40 GMT).\nThey targeted aircraft, aircraft shelters, storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers and air defence systems at the Syrian government-controlled facility, according to the Pentagon.\nIt said the base was used to store chemical weapons and that \"every precaution\" had been taken to avoid casualties. The Russian military was informed beforehand, the Pentagon said.\nUnnamed US intelligence sources have told media they believe Russian personnel were at Shayrat when Sarin, a nerve agent, was loaded on to a Syrian jet but they have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening.\nRetired civil servant Mateea Zefa, who lives near the base, went with his children to look at the base afterwards and found it \"totally destroyed\".\n\"We saw lots of bombs,\" he told the BBC by phone. \"Loads of them. It was a tough night. My house was damaged, almost all the windows broke and some walls cracked.\"\nHouses on one side of the base were also \"totally destroyed\", he added.\nSome children and other people were injured by shards of breaking glass but no civilians were killed, she said.\nThe dead and seriously injured were all soldiers, she said, adding that they had been brought to her hospital.\nThe Syrian army said earlier there had been significant damage to the base.\nHowever, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition news service, said  on Friday evening the base was already back in operation and aircraft had taken off and \"struck targets near Palmyra\". The report could not be independently verified.\nThe US has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against jihadist groups in Syria since 2014 but this is the first time it has targeted government forces.\nPresident Trump previously spoke out against US military involvement in Syria, instead calling for a greater focus on domestic interests.\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy on Thursday, saying that Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria.\nRussia says it has formally notified the Pentagon that as of 21:00 GMT on Friday their air force hotline for Syrian airspace will close down.\nIt also sent a frigate armed with cruise missiles, the Admiral Grigorovich, from the Black Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean on Friday, in what may be a routine move.","summary":"The US envoy to the UN has warned America may take further action after bombarding a Syrian air base suspected of using chemical weapons.","id":"39529264"}

{"document":"He is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born British man in his mid-20s from west London, who was previously known to British security services.\nBritish police declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations.\nEmwazi first appeared in a video last August, when he apparently killed the US journalist James Foley.\nHe was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.\nIn each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose.\nSpeaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown.\nEarlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded. Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were known collectively as \"the Beatles\".\nMohammed Emwazi timeline:\nSource: Cage, London-based campaign group\n'Jihadi John' movement mapped\nEmwazi \"claimed harassment\"\nIn a news conference, Asim Qureshi, the research director of the London-based lobby group Cage, which had been in contact with Emwazi over a number of years, explained how he had been approached by the Washington Post for the story and detailed the difficulties Emwazi had had with security services in the UK and overseas.\nMr Qureshi said Emwazi, who is understood to be about 27, had been \"extremely kind, gentle and soft-spoken, the most humble young person I knew\".\nHe said he could \"not be 100% certain\" Jihadi John was Emwazi although there were \"striking similarities\".\nEmwazi's difficulties began when he travelled to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation in computer programming at the University of Westminster, Mr Qureshi added.\nHe and two friends had planned to go on a safari but once they landed in Dar es Salaam they were detained by police and held overnight.\nEmwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK.\nAnalysis: Frank Gardner, BBC News\nUS and British counter-terrorism officials discovered the identity of \"Jihadi John\" as far back as last September. The FBI, Britain's MI5 and other intelligence agencies used a combination of voice recognition software, interviews with former hostages and on-the-ground research in London to build up a profile of the man now revealed to be Mohammed Emwazi.\nThey have always declined to reveal the name for \"operational reasons\". Now that it's out in the public domain, it's emerged that Emwazi was well-known to MI5 and that it even tried to recruit him as an informer, years before he went off to Syria to eventually join Islamic State.\nThe practice by intelligence agencies of approaching jihadist sympathisers to work for them is likely to continue. It's believed both Britain and the US have informers inside the Islamic State \"capital\" of Raqqa. Yet this seems to have been little help in stopping the actions of Mohammed Emwazi, or bringing him to justice.\nProfile: Mohammed Emwazi\nJihadist's 'typical trajectory'\nEmwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in 2010, he was detained by British counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait, his friends said.\n\"I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,\" Emwazi wrote in a June 2010 email to Cage.\n\"[But now] I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London,\" he added, \"a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and country, Kuwait.\"\nMr Qureshi said Emwazi had made persistent efforts to try to change his situation: \"We had two-and-a-half years of communications talking about what he could do to alleviate his problems.\"\nHe said he did not know what had happened to Emwazi, adding: \"When we treat people as if they are outsiders they will inevitably feel like outsiders - our entire national security strategy for the last 13 years has only increased alienation. A narrative of injustice has taken root.\"\nEmwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2013 and later joined IS, which has declared the creation of a \"caliphate\" in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls.\nA spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron would not confirm or deny the latest reports, adding that the police and security services were working hard to find those responsible for the murder of the British hostages.\nThe University of Westminster confirmed Emwazi had left six years ago, adding: \"If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened.\"\nThe BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the FBI went on record last September to confirm it knew who Jihadi John was. However, US officials said this month they would not name him as they believed this would be the best strategy for finding him and bringing him to justice.\nA spokesman for the family of Steven Sotloff said: \"We want to sit in a courtroom, watch him sentenced and see him sent to a super-max prison.\"\nDavid Haines's sister, Bethany, welcomed the identification, but told ITV News: \"I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.\"\nJihadi John sightings","summary":"The masked Islamic State militant known as \"Jihadi John\", who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages, has been named.","id":"31637090"}

She and her colleague, 68-year-old support worker Anne Wilson, work at a mental health unit in Surrey.\nIt can be physically challenging work and involve unsociable hours but that doesn't put them off.\n\"I love my work, love it,\" says Maureen. \"I've been doing it all my life. I love the patients and I feel, with my experience, I've got a lot to offer.\"\nThe NHS is reviewing employment for older workers, but Anne does not believe they are denying openings to the next generation.\n\"We're saying 'yes we can do it. We're mature, we're old but we're not written off.\"\nThere are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60.\nBut better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead.\nNot everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though.\nFor Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss.  But for big employers, it's not so simple.\nThe NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers.\nIn England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday.\nIt's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages.\nBut would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions.\nThe government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048.\nAs a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates.\nBut many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload.\nHe loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire.\n\"I do need the money,\" he says. \"If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough.\"\nThe self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do.\nMany of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want.\nBut if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them.\nSource: ONS\/NHS\nThere are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want.\nAnd in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers  after the state retirement age was abolished.\nBut older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old.\nAnd many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years.\nIt's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher.\nAnd if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker.\nFor many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned.","summary":"As his 80th birthday approached, Bob Hooker decided to slow down a little.","id":"24629576"}

A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.\nThe exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter.\nOnce the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters \"SF?\" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: \"Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time.\"\nTaliban release video of handover\nSgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the \"Standing with Bowe\" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho.\nNegotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began three years ago with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar.\nBut the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.\nDirect negotiations broke down a year ago when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar.\nThe issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap.\nOn Thursday, Mr Obama said Sgt Bergdahl's health was deteriorating and officials were \"deeply concerned about it\".\nBut the prisoner swap was apparently sped up after US officials determined the Taliban would likely kill Sgt Bergdahl if any word of the deal was leaked, according to congressional and White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press.\nDefence Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC's Katty Kay he and other military chiefs based their decision \"on the information that we had, that his life, his health, were in peril\".\nHis father Robert Bergdahl said Bowe was struggling to speak English after his long captivity. In an emotional White House lawn press conference with Barack Obama shortly after the release, Robert Bergdahl delivered his son a message in Pashto, the language of his captors.\nAfter immediate medical attention at a military hospital in Germany,  Sgt Bergdahl was flown to San Antonio, Texas, to continue treatment.\nOn Friday, Army officials said he was in a \"stable condition\".\nHe \"looked good\", was in uniform, and saluted, Maj Gen Joseph DiSalvo said.\n\"He appeared just like any sergeant would when they see a two-star general - a little bit nervous,\" Gen DiSalvo said. \"But he looked good, saluted, and had good deportment.\"\nCan you lose your language?\nThe exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari.\nThey are thought to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001.\nFazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims.\nKhairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden.\nUS President Barack Obama says Qatar has given assurances \"that it will put in place measures to protect our national security\".\nUnder the deal, the five freed Taliban detainees will be banned from leaving Qatar for at least a year, meaning they cannot return to Afghanistan until after a majority of US forces have left.\nThe Associated Press' Kathy Gannon, who was shot in Afghanistan while covering the recent elections, says the five men are important but not likely to change the balance of the war - and having been away from Afghanistan for more than a decade, they would not find Taliban foot soldiers very loyal.\nSome argue there is US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran.\nBut Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called it a fundamental shift in policy that would act as an incentive for further abductions of US personnel.\nSome US lawmakers have complained the swap breaches a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House says it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in \"unique and exigent circumstances\".\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, normally a White House ally, was enraged that the president had not notified her or the intelligence committee she leads, of the pending swap, although a White House official did call her on Monday to apologise for the delay.\nThe US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives.\nRepublican Senator John McCain told the BBC the swaps \"threatened\" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers have called for a inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process.\nBut Mr Obama is publically unapologetic for the swap.\n\"We saw an opportunity and we seized it,\" he said, adding \"as commander-in-chief I am responsible for those kids\".\nNo Obama apology for Bergdahl deal\nCorrespondents say it is unclear what impact the release will have on a wider peace process.\nThe Afghan High Peace Council want talks with the Taliban to happen inside Afghanistan, and does not want to involve the Americans.\nBowe Bergdahl returned to the US on 13 June 2014, arriving at a medical centre in Texas where he finished the last phase of his reintegration process.\nIn his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, a rally scheduled months ahead was quickly turned into a homecoming event that was cancelled.\nCity officials cited safety concerns, because of a large increase in the number of expected attendees, and local officials have received messages blasting the town for honouring Sgt Bergdahl's return.\nSgt Bergdahl returned to active duty in July, working at a desk job at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.\nIn March 2015, he was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehaviour before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command unit or place.\nA preliminary hearing will be heard in front of a judge at Fort Sam Houston. A date has not been set for that hearing.\nHe faces up to five years in prison on the desertion charge and life in prison on the misbehaviour charge.\nHow to 'reintegrate' a returning POW","summary":"US Sgt Bowe Bergdahl has been released five years after being captured by Afghan Taliban, in a controversial exchange for five Taliban officials being held at Guantanamo Bay.","id":"27654454"}

{"document":"The Office for National Statistics said there were 3.5 million such households in the UK between April and June this year, about 17.1% of all households including a working age adult.\nThis was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier.\nThe highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England.\nSome 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.\nWorkless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.\nPeople may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.\nThe data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.\nThis means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.\nSome 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.\nChildren's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.\nHowever, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.\nThey said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.\nThe proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.\nIn 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, this figure drops to 224,000.\nMark Hoban, the Minister for Employment, said: \"Helping people off benefits and into work is one of this government's top priorities, so it is good news that the number of workless households has fallen by more than 425,000 since the coalition took office.\n\"By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits, and through schemes such as the Work Programme and Youth Contract we are giving people the support they need to get a job and fulfil their aspirations of looking after themselves and their families.\"\nStephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: \"Any fall in worklessness is welcome, but the truth is Britain's unemployment crisis is far from over.\n\"Underemployment is at record highs, long-term unemployment is at its highest level for 17 years, the number of young people out of work is edging back towards a million, and millions are working harder for less. It is becoming harder and harder for millions to make ends meet.\"","summary":"The proportion of UK households where no adult aged 16 to 64 is in work is at its lowest since comparable records began in 1996, official figures show.","id":"23862993"}

{"document":"Offences for which lower compensation was awarded included ones involving drink, drugs or violence.\nThe Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority said statutory guidance obliged it to reduce or refuse awards if victims had unspent convictions.\nA leading child abuse lawyer called for a review of the \"scandalous\" approach.\nAlan Collins said civil case judges increasingly took the opposite view, and accepted that abuse could have a lifelong effect, with addictions being a possible consequence.\nSince 2010, CICA - an executive agency sponsored by the Ministry of Justice - has awarded compensation to 12,665 people who were sexually abused as children, or as adults lacking mental capacity.\nBut some 438 people have had their government-funded compensation reduced because they had committed criminal offences themselves, the BBC learned after a series of Freedom of Information requests.\nOf the 27 cases where compensation was reduced between June 2014 and June 2015, half were for drink, drugs, theft or property offences. Eight involved violence against people.\nCICA would not say how many applications by such victims had been rejected.\n\"The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme has always asked that awards are reduced or refused if the victim had unspent convictions,\" it said in a statement.\nThe Ministry of Justice said the refusal or reduction of an awarded payment reflected the fact the individual \"may have caused distress, loss or injury to another person, and cost the taxpayer money through a police investigation or court proceedings\".\nIt said there were no plans to review the scheme.\nOdette Tovey, a Sheffield-based legal representative for several grooming victims whose applications have been rejected by CICA, said: \"The crimes committed against the victims far outweigh the crimes that these victims committed.\"\nSome of these had been abused for many years, from their early teens, added Ms Tovey, and CICA was their only route to potential compensation.\nMs Tovey said CICA needed to take into consideration that victims' crimes \"were as a result of mental health problems developed because of the period of abuse they went through\".\nVictims could be eligible for compensation of ÃÂ£27,000 if no deductions were made, said Ms Tovey.\nThe average award after CICA compensation reduction was ÃÂ£8,423.\nJane was groomed and abused for more than four years after running away from her South Yorkshire home at the age of 15.\nShe was given drugs and alcohol and forced to have sex with men she did not know.\nA lead witness at her abuser's trial, Jane was turned down for compensation because she has unspent convictions for theft and assault - offences which took place before the trial took place and when she says she was addicted to so-called legal highs.\nShe has since given up drugs, has married, and is pregnant with her first child.\nJane - not her real name - has paid back the money she stole and says she feels remorse for her actions, but says they should not negate her compensation.\nShe told the BBC: \"I've hurt someone else, they didn't expect to be hurt, they didn't deserve to be hurt, I just hurt them so I could get money.\n\"I've been told by a couple of people that they received about ÃÂ£15,000, and that makes me really angry - because while the main witnesses haven't received anything, the others have.\"","summary":"Compensation has been reduced for more than 400 sex abuse victims in Britain who later committed criminal offences, the BBC has learnt.","id":"33707529"}

That's just not right,\" he said.\n\"I've ordered an immediate investigation to look at the evidence and consider the views of employees, customers and the industry to see how we can deal with the abuse of tipping.\"\nAnalysis by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nRestaurants have the highest corporate mortality rate.\nThey pop up and disappear from our high streets with daffodil-like regularity. That's because consumer tastes can change rapidly but also because profit margins are often very low.\nAdd in high rents and staff costs in Britain's largest cities and restaurants will say they need to maximise every source of income to stay afloat.\nBut consumers tend to side with waiting staff when it comes to tips. They assume staff will see most, if not all of them - especially if customers have been asked to pay an 'optional' service charge of at least 10% on their bill.\nAdding tips to the existing code of practice among restaurants (which is voluntary anyway) may be the solution. But it may be tough to police.\nMost waiting staff are either young or foreign - meaning they don't know the law and don't wish to upset their employers.\nAs part of the investigation information and views from the hospitality industry and other key stakeholders will be sought.\nThis will help the government decide if ministers need to intervene to strengthen the voluntary code of practice.\nUfi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said the body \"would welcome dialogue with the business secretary on the matter of tipping and the industry code of conduct.\"\nMost chains use a \"tronc\" system, where all the tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, usually with around 70% going to the waiters, and the rest given to kitchen and other workers.\nThere is no law regarding how a tronc is divided, however.\nA spokesperson for Pizza Express said: \"To cover the administrative costs of ensuring that the tronc system is managed correctly and fairly, a small administrative fee of 8% is levied. Under no circumstances does Pizza Express generate additional profit through the tronc.\"\nMany high-street chains deduct fees from tips. These include: Ask (8%), Belgo (10%), Bella Italia (10%), CafÃÂ© Rouge (10%), Prezzo (10%), Strada (10%) and Zizzi (8%).\nRecently Giraffe has scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips, joining chains like Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's who do not deduct a fee.\nResearch from 2009 found that one in five restaurants did not pass tips to their staff, yet the vast majority of customers said they wanted waiting staff to receive the money left for them, the government said.","summary":"Business Secretary Sajid Javid has ordered an investigation into the \"abuse\" of tipping in restaurants.","id":"34102536"}

At the top end there are 1,200 executive suite seats, and at the other there are 2,000 tickets available at $15.\n\"It is part of our message to the community - we want to make sure that anyone can attend a game,\" says Mr Yormark.\nThe Barclays Center will also provide 2,000 jobs for local people.\nThere are also Nets ticket packages, which call for a commitment of three years, but which allow access to tickets for other events at the Barclays Center before the general public can buy.\n\"This was the first product of its kind in New York,\" says Mr Yormark.\n\"If you are a business person and you know you are going to need tickets for college sport, boxing, family shows, then you know you can get them from the Nets.\"\nHe says that some 12% of the ticket base that was with the Nets in New Jersey has pledged to follow the team over in Brooklyn.\n\"We try to do our best for fans,\" says Mr Yormark. \"We promised that if they stuck with us [for the last season] in New Jersey they would get first chance at the Brooklyn tickets.\"\nMeanwhile he says that sponsorship income is up three times on last year's figure.\nBarclays is the title sponsor of the new venue, and there are 12 founding partners, which include big names like American Express and Honda.\n\"It is an exciting time - you don't often get a chance to transfer a team into a new major market.\"\nThe move will certainly establish a local rivalry with the New York Knicks team, who the Brooklyn Nets will play in the first match of the season on 1 November.\n\"The first game will make for a very tremendous moment, and gives people a lot to talk about,\" says Mr Yormark.\nThe move has not been without its difficulties, with protests and political hurdles to be overcome.\nBut Mr Yormark sees the delays as actually having had a beneficial effect.\n\"I look at everything with a silver lining,\" he says.\n\"The economy is better than it was, Brooklyn is a more dynamic market than it was, the time is right to bring sport back to Brooklyn.\"","summary":"Few, if any, leading sports clubs can say that a top rap star has played a role in their rebirth, but that is the case with the newly founded Brooklyn Nets basketball team.","id":"19503482"}

And our parents... thanks for not making us get jobs!\" said the band as they accepted their award.\nThe four-piece, who met at university in Leeds in 2007 but are now based in Cambridge, said the award would probably give them \"a level of security\".\n\"The Mercury Awards puts us in the hall of fame for sure, because it's such a well respected award,\" said frontman Joe Newman backstage.\nAlt-J also rubbished the idea of the so-called 'Mercury curse', a term coined after previous winners such as Speech Debelle failed to live up to the hype.\n\"This kind of curse isn't dependent on whether you win the Mercury. It's dependent on the material that you have after you win the Mercury,\" said Newman.\n\"We feel as a group we have a real strong set of songs, future songs. It's about the artist.\"\nThe band revealed they would be celebrating by getting drunk.\nHowever they did add they would spend some of the prize money taking their parents out for a slap-up meal, after their families had watched the awards on TV while hosting their own Mercury-themed parties.\nEach of the 12 nominated acts performed live at this year's ceremony, in its new home, the Roundhouse in north London.\nPlan B, real name Ben Drew, opened the show with the title track from his nominated album Ill Manors, which is the soundtrack to the film he wrote, directed and starred in.\nHe performed from the top of a new-look double-decker stage in the Camden venue, the same spot where The Maccabees later brought the show to a close with a high energy rendition of Pelican.\nBBC 6 Music presenter Lauren Laverne replaced longtime host Jools Holland as coverage of the event moved from BBC Two to Channel 4.\nRadio 1's new Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw fronted the backstage coverage.\nOther standout performances came from La Havas, who silenced the room, and Ware who like many of the nominees said they were happy just to be nominated.\nMost have already enjoyed a sales boost while the act behind this year's 'token jazz album', Roller Trio, said they received a host of new bookings and got a new agent the day after being nominated.\nHMV's Gennaro Castaldo predicted Alt-J's win could result in a \"five or sixfold\" increase in sales.\nLast week, fellow nominees Django Django, who met at art college in Edinburgh, won Q magazine's best new act award.\nHowever they admitted they were a little nervous as the Mercury's evening kicked off.\n\"It feels a bit like we're all about to get married. To each other,\" said Django drummer and producer Dave Maclean.\nHe had designed the band's matching shirts especially for the event, but afterwards insisted there were no hard feelings and they were glad Alt-J had won as it was \"a good album\".\nLast year PJ Harvey became the first act to win the Mercury Prize twice, when her album Let England Shake took the prize.\nThis year bookmakers William Hill had reported a late surge of betting for Sheffield troubadour Hawley, who received his second nomination for Standing at the Sky's Edge.\nHe said the Mercury Prize, which has faced criticism for becoming too predictable, was \"massively important\" as it celebrated the album as \"an art form\".\n\"It's a thing in culture that we're losing,\" he explained on the red carpet, likening buying MP3s to \"buying a bucket of steam\".\n\"An album is a sequential series of musical events that elicits an emotional response - all you need to do is give it your time.\"\nHawley continued: \"I'm the oldest guy nominated here and I like the album as something that you engage with, it gives you so much.\n\"Our relationship with music has changed so massively in such a short space of time. Music is something we need, it's not a luxury.\"\nRecent figures from Music Week show that sales of artist albums are down by 15.3% year on year, while single sales are rising.\nHowever this year's winners Alt-J are also proud to call their debut record \"an album-y album\", designed to be listened to in its entirety.\n\"That's why we were so happy to be nominated for the Mercury, because we're album people I think,\" said the band's keyboard player Gus Unger-Hamilton.\n\"I'm not saying we made the album thinking, 'this is going to win a mercury', but just 'I hope people appreciate this as a single body of work'.\"\nHowever, as An Awesome Wave was five years in the making, fans may have to wait a while for the follow up.\n\"We didn't rush anything, we were patient and we took our time,\" explained Newman.\n\"That's certainly something that we're going to consider for our second album. You can't rush creativity, and you can't rush working with a group of guys.\"","summary":"Indie rock band Alt-J have been named winners of this year's prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize, with their debut album An Awesome Wave.","id":"20176215"}

{"document":"In 2015\/16, 55% of licence fee funds raised in Scotland was spent on local and Scottish network content.\nDonalda MacKinnon said it was her ambition to see the amount spent \"better reflect\" what is collected.\nThe Scottish government has been calling for BBC Scotland to have more power over commissioning and budgets.\nMs MacKinnon recently took over as director, the senior editorial figure for BBC Scotland's output across television, radio and online, after Ken MacQuarrie moved to become director of nations and regions.\nIn an interview with Good Morning Scotland, she said one of her immediate ambitions was to increase how much of the licence fee money raised in Scotland was spent locally.\nThe BBC's 2015\/16 accounts showed Â£320m was raised from the licence fee in Scotland. Of that, Â£176.5m was spent on local content and Scottish-made BBC network output, 55% of the total raised.\nThis was a sharp decline from the Â£203m spend the previous year, which was 63% of the Â£323m collected. The funds not spent locally go towards BBC programmes developed elsewhere and aired across the UK.\nIn comparison, 95% of licence fee funds raised in Wales in 2015\/16 were spent in Wales - including on network-wide programmes like Doctor Who, Casualty and Crimewatch - with the figure for Northern Ireland standing at 74%.\nMs MacKinnon said: \"I have made it very clear that it is my ambition to change that number. The percentage of the licence fee collected in Scotland I think has to reflect better the amount spent in Scotland.\n\"I don't want to commit to a figure exactly at the moment, but certainly an increase on what is the case that moment, which is 55% of the licence fee.\n\"I think we have a new opportunity to define exactly what kind of BBC in Scotland audiences expect and the kind of resource it rightly should claim, relative to the amount of licence fee collected in Scotland.\"\nThe new director also pledged to abolish \"lift and shift\", where programmes traditionally produced elsewhere are moved to Scotland in order to meet quotas.\nHolyrood's culture committee issued a report describing this practice as \"subverting the spirit of the quota\", with MSPs saying this gave them \"serious cause for concern\".\nMs MacKinnon said this had happened due to a target in 2008 to raise network television productions coming from Scotland from 3% of the total aired to 8.6%. She said she had made a \"serious commitment\" to see the practice end.\nShe said: \"I understand why that happened early doors, I don't think that should happen any more and we've had a very solid commitment to the effect that that will not happen except in extremis.\"\nMs MacKinnon also said she was targeting an \"improvement in appreciation\" of BBC Scotland's news output, saying it was \"really important\" to consolidate public trust in the corporation following events like the 2014 independence referendum.\nShe said: \"We have very successful news output, but there's no doubt that there was a feeling among a significant percentage of the population - not the total population - that trust might need to be rebuilt.\n\"I think it was proven by research undertaken by the BBC Trust that that we had not breached any impartiality and could not be accused of being biased.\n\"Did we sometimes get it wrong? Possibly.\n\"If we get it wrong - and there's no doubt we are all human beings, and we can do - we should put our hands up and say yeah, sorry, we may have got that wrong, but we certainly, as far as I'm concerned, can't be accused of bias.\"\nMs MacKinnon was asked about the case of Nick Robinson who as BBC political editor was the subject of controversy during the independence campaign.\nThe BBC Trust and Editorial Complaints Unit found that Mr Robinson's assertion that then-First Minister Alex Salmond had not answered a question put to him during a news conference gave a misleading impression.\nBut it concluded that his report was not intentionally biased and rejected complaints.\nMr Salmond subsequently claimed BBC bias was a \"significant factor\" in the outcome of the independence referendum.\nMs MacKinnon said the BBC should be more open about admitting when mistakes are made, while explaining its position and defending its journalism against claims of bias.\nShe said: \"I really do believe that we need to get our narrative right, and we need to be out there a bit more often just explaining some of that.\n\"It's arguable that had we done that, then the population would have understood better what it is that we're here to do.\n\"Getting that story out, whether it's from the director general or me or someone else, it's something I will want to address.\"\nThe new director said it was \"regrettable\" that this had not happened more often during the independence referendum.\nShe said: \"I can understand the reasons for the reluctance and reticence to be there, given the tension around the whole debate. But I believe it's really important for us to demonstrate accountability and openness, and to reflect very hard on some of the challenges.\"","summary":"BBC Scotland's new director has pledged to spend more licence fee funds raised north of the border on programming produced in Scotland.","id":"38266253"}

{"document":"Champagne tastes like sheet metal after the third glass. Sunbathing gives you cancer. And the ubiquity of Henry Moore sculptures in English market towns in the 1970s put me off his work for a quarter of a century.\nBack then, in Harold Wilson's Britain, Moore's monumental stone figures and giant abstract casts had the same worthy municipal feel as the local town hall.\nAny conurbation large enough to support a Boots, a cinema and a public convenience seemed compelled to plonk an enormous Moore sculpture on a prize piece of public real estate.\nHis misshapen family groups and huge pierced boulders of bronze were like those fashionable avocado bathrooms - not nearly as groovy as the older generation thought. More Abigail's Party than the Sex Pistols.\nI wasn't alone in wanting no more Moore.\nIn 1967, he offered the Tate Gallery \"20 or 30 major pieces\". Fellow artists were less keen, saying it was wrong to devote so much space to a single living artist (Moore had insisted his gift be on permanent display, which would have taken up a sizable chunk of the Tate's sculpture galleries).\nThe Tate declined - and the artist gave the work to a grateful Art Gallery of Ontario instead.\nThat was then.\nForty years later, I have aged, and so have Moore's sculptures. They have fared much better than me - they look terrific now.\nMaybe it's their sense of calm permanence in our superficial, super-fast world, or my romanticising of Moore's post-war vision of modernity.\nEither way, it was a pleasure to spend yesterday at his old home in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, which is now The Henry Moore Foundation.\nHe was a sincere and dedicated artist who knew he wanted to be a sculptor aged 11, had his first commissions in his teens, and went on to excel at the Leeds School of Art.\nThere he met and befriended another aspiring young sculptor called Barbara Hepworth, who, like Moore, was inspired by the Yorkshire landscape of their birth.\nHe read widely, immersed himself in art and drew on influences far and wide, from primitive African artefacts to Parisian Cubism.\nHis intellectual and technical wherewithal enabled him to successfully incorporate all these ingredients into harmonious, pleasing forms that feel both ancient and modern.\nIt's what gives his work such broad appeal and why it can be seen in hundreds of cities around the world - there is something in it for everyone.\nHis drawings of sheep and apple trees have an intensity and energy that feels kinetic. You'll see plenty of the real thing if you sit at his old oak desk in the little shed with a picture window that looks out onto the fields of sheep that frequently wander over to look at you.\nThere are some good drawings from his student days, which you can see in an exhibition opening this Saturday at the Foundation called Becoming Henry Moore.\nThere are plenty of sculptures, too, in the exhibition and dotted about the 70 acres of landscape, which the canny Moore used as a showroom for potential clients.\nThey look good. Much better than they did in those tired old market towns.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Get Me Out Of Here! and Celebrity Big Brother.\nShowbiz world pays tribute to Gest\nHe had planned to tour the UK in July with his latest show, called the David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul Tour!\nSeveral singers were due to appear on the tour, including Dina Carroll and Freda Payne.\nIt was named after the mix-up on this year's Celebrity Big Brother, when Angie Bowie informed Tiffany Pollard that David - meaning her ex-husband Bowie - had died during their time on the reality show. Pollard broke down in tears believing Gest, who was ill in bed at the time, had died.\nGest stayed in the Celebrity Big Brother house for 13 days but left the series on medical grounds.\nIn 2007 he was admitted to hospital with chest pains and respiratory problems.\nOne of the biggest successes during his career was producing the highest-rated special in US music history - 2001's Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration.\nHe was perhaps best known for his marriage to Minnelli. They were married in 2002 and officially divorced in 2007. He was also a childhood friend of Jackson and his brother Tito.\nGest's name-dropping anecdotes and raucous tales of showbiz friendships during his appearances on reality TV shows won him legions of fans in the UK.\nHe finished fourth in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here in 2006, and later became a judge on talent show Grease Is The Word.\nIn 2011, Sir Cliff Richard worked with Gest on his album Soulicious.\nGest helped develop the concept of the album, which saw Sir Cliff collaborate with soul singers including Roberta Flack and Candi Staton. He later produced and directed the Soulicious tour.\nMr Handi, who confirmed the news of Gest's death, described him as a \"huge talent\".\n\"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\n\"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\"\nA Metropolitan Police statement said: \"Police were called at 10:17 on Tuesday 12 April to the Four Seasons hotel, in Westferry Circus to reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s.\n\"London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel. A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed.\"\nPolice have said there appear to be no suspicious circumstances.\nGest was born on May 11 1953 in Los Angeles, California. He worked as a music video and television producer and last year he toured the UK with David Gest's (I've Had) The Time Of My Life Tour - which played 14 cities.\nHe released an autobiography, titled Simply The Gest, in 2007.\nLast month, Gest told the Hull Daily Mail: \"I don't live the showbusiness world in my private life.\n\"I don't go to many openings, or many premieres - that's not what I'm about, I did that more when I was younger.\"\nGest's appearance often hit the headlines, and he said having cosmetic surgery was his \"biggest regret\".\nFor the last few years of his life Gest lived in York - shying away from his former lifestyle in LA.\nHe told the Yorkshire Post in 2014: \"It's my home and the most beautiful place in the world. You look at the Minster, the cobblestone streets, the history with the Vikings and the River Ouse running through.\n\"It also has the York Hog Roast. People come by and see me eating there and I tell them I'm having my turkey and my Yorkshire pudding, my stuffing, my crackling, my vegetables and my gravy and I'm loving every minute of it.\"\nDespite his celebrity credentials, Gest prided himself on being a man of the people, telling the newspaper: \"I don't look at celebrity the way others look at it.\n\"I'm down to earth. People come up to me in the streets in York and I talk with everybody. I don't believe there's really a difference between any of us.\"\nGest married actress and singer Judy Garland's daughter Minnelli in 2002 in a star-studded wedding at New York's St Regis hotel.\nThe couple's 300 guests included Michael Jackson, Dame Joan Collins and Martine McCutcheon.\nJackson was the best man at the ceremony, arriving with matron of honour Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Ross.\nHis brothers Tito, Marlon, Randy and Jackie were among the groomsmen.\nMcCutcheon, together with actresses Mia Farrow and Janet Leigh and singer Petula Clark, was a bridesmaid at the ceremony.\nGest and Minnelli announced their separation a year later and divorced in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault.","summary":"Entertainer, producer and reality television star David Gest has died in a London hotel aged 62, a statement from his friend says.","id":"36028232"}

{"document":"The official is said to have acted as a CIA contact at the US embassy, reports say, in a scandal that has infuriated German politicians.\nA German intelligence official was arrested last week on suspicion of spying.\nAn inquiry has also begun into a German defence ministry worker, reports said.\n\"The representative of the US intelligence services at the embassy of the United States of America has been told to leave Germany,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.\nAnalysis by Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington\nEarlier this week the White House described the partnership between the US and Germany as one built on respect. But no-one likes to be spied on, especially when it's your friend doing the spying.\nThis latest episode is yet another reminder of how American surveillance programmes are causing friction with allies. It's angered many in Germany, where the issue of snooping is historically a very sensitive one, and many are asking: \"What? Again?\"\nIt wasn't too long ago, after all, that we heard the National Security Agency was spying on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone. After a review into the surveillance programmes, President Obama promised the US wouldn't spy on its friends overseas.\nBut despite requests to be included, Germany isn't part of a non-spying pact the US has with Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The White House will want to do all it can to repair any trust issues over this latest incident, so they can work together in other areas - for example, it needs German support for tougher sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.\nAnalysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Berlin\nThe request by the German government follows increasing frustration that it has failed to get US assurances that spying would cease on German citizens from Chancellor Merkel down.\nShe was shocked to learn that her mobile phone conversations were secretly being monitored while President Obama was greeting her as a friend on his visit to Berlin.\nChancellor Merkel has tried to maintain a balance between condemning America's actions but also maintaining cordial relations. Each revelation has made that balance harder to achieve.\nThis matters because America needs German help on a range of issues from trying to get the world economy out of its difficulties, to finding united Western action on Russia, to dealing with the revelations emanating from Edward Snowden who is currently in Moscow but whom some German lawmakers want to invite to Berlin.\nThe chairman of the Bundestag (parliament) committee overseeing the secret service said the action had been taken because of America's spying on German politicians and its failure to co-operate and provide adequate responses.\nThe US has not denied allegations that a German intelligence agency employee arrested last week was passing secret documents to the US National Security Agency (NSA).\nHowever, the latest reports that an employee within the defence ministry was also spying for the US were considered more serious. Although no arrest was made, searches were carried out on Wednesday at the ministry and elsewhere.\nThe US and Germany have been close allies for decades but relations were hit last year when it emerged that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been monitored by the NSA.\nThe White House declined to comment on the matter but said the security and intelligence relationship with Germany \"is a very important one and keeps Germans and Americans safe\".\n\"It is essential that co-operation continue in all areas and we will continue to be in touch with the German government in appropriate channels,\" spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.\nOctober 2013: German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls US President Barack Obama after revelations that the US may have spied on her mobile phone\nJune 2014: Germany announces an investigation into the claims\n4 July 2014: A suspected US spy said to be working for the German intelligence agency is arrested\n9 July 2014: A second case emerges as searches are carried out at the defence ministry\n10 July 2014: German government orders expulsion of CIA official\nOn Thursday, Mrs Merkel said spying on allies was a \"waste of energy\".\n\"We have so many problems, we should focus on the important things,\" she said.\n\"In the Cold War maybe there was general mistrust. Today we are living in the 21st Century. Today there are completely new threats.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the information that the US appeared to have gained from the suspected espionage was \"laughable\" but the political damage was \"disproportionate and serious\".\nThe scale of the US agency's surveillance was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the US and is now a fugitive in Russia.\nThe German intelligence official arrested last week was alleged to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee investigating the NSA spying scandal.\nWhen Mrs Merkel visited the White House in May, President Barack Obama sought to assure her and the German people they were not subject to \"continual surveillance\" by the US.\nHe said \"complicated issues\" were involved but he anticipated that the matter would be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries.","summary":"The German government has ordered the expulsion of a CIA official in Berlin in response to two cases of alleged spying by the US.","id":"28243933"}

It is also said to have benefits for diabetes sufferers.\nAccording to Dr Tom Bassindale, a lecturer in forensic science at Sheffield Hallam University, it was developed in Latvia and approved in the early 2000s to treat diabetes and various heart-related diseases.\nDr Bassindale says it has the ability to adjust the body's use of energy, stimulating glucose metabolism and also helping to clear fatty build-up in the arteries.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe ability to increase oxygen movement to muscles means meldonium could have a positive effect on stamina and endurance.\nDr Bassindale said: \"It's advertised as giving a mental focus, removing external stress so you feel sharper. There is a slight central nervous system effect, like with stimulants such as caffeine, which gives you a sharper edge.\n\"But it will aid recovery quicker from a hard effort, whether that's playing multiple games of tennis or a cyclist coming back the next day for another stage. There is also an endurance effect.\"\nIn a word: yes. It is not licensed in the UK, so is therefore illegal to sell there. But it is not illegal to import it from abroad for personal use.\nFollowing Sharapova's announcement, Russian supplements website RUPharma told BBC Sport it is had sold 150 packets of the drug in 24 hours, compared with 850 in the past 12 months.\nThe website says it has increased the price of a packet of 40 250mg tablets from Â£15 to Â£27 and employ a new member of staff to deal with the demand.\n\"As a joke, we now call mildronate the Sharaponate,\" said a spokesperson, who added that most of their sales are to UK and USA customers and the majority are for sport, rather than medicinal, use.\nThe UK government's Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency urges people to not buy unlicensed drugs from abroad, as there is no guarantee that customers know if the product is safe.\nAssuming the product is what it says on the label, there are no tests that show any serious side effects.\nA Latvian manufacturer of the product - OlainFarm - says it is possible that some using the drug will suffer \"headaches\" and \"agitation\". It is also possible for there to be some skin irritation, though this is \"very rare\".\nRUPharma said: \"We do not know of any negative side effects, unless of course one overdoses. But that applies to any product or medicine.\"\nDr Bassindale added that he would expect it to have \"gone through significant testing\" in Latvia.\nLast year, as part of Wada's monitoring of meldonium, a testing centre in the German city of Cologne found that 182 of 8,320 random urine samples gave positive results for the drug - a rate of 2.2%.\n\"That's huge,\" says Dr Bassindale. \"The overall positive tests for all other doping was about 2% from 280,000 tests.\"\nBBC Russian's Pavel Fendenko said the drug is frequently sold over the counter in Russia and prescribed by cardiologists.\n\"In 2013, the Russian government put it on a list of essential drugs - on a par with things like insulin - which makes it subject to certain price caps,\" he said.\nAfter monitoring the use of meldonium and researching its properties, Wada decided it was a performance-enhancing drug and should therefore be added to the banned list.\nDr Bassindale said: \"When deciding whether to ban a drug, Wada looks at three things. Will it enhance performance? Is it detrimental to the health of an athlete? Is it against the 'spirit of sport'?\n\"To be banned, a drug must 'fail' two of these three tests. Presumably, in this case, they have also decided the drug is against the 'spirit of sport'.\"\nIf 2.2% of random samples showed levels of the drug, then it is clearly being widely used, but it is impossible to tell how many samples tested positive for legitimate medical reasons.\nDr Bassindale says Sharapova's positive test may reduce the number of athletes using meldonium.\n\"This might have persuaded people to be much more careful,\" he said.","summary":"Meldonium was barely on the radar until five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova revealed she recorded a positive drugs test for the substance.","id":"35758901"}

We'll have seven in total and then we'll fully deploy all the solar panels,\" he told BBC News.\nInmarsat is a dominant force in the so-called Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) market.\nIts principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need connectivity away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.\nCustomers can use Inmarsat services to make phone calls, to transfer audio-visual material or simple data.\nThe company's fastest growing sector currently is aviation, and the GX constellation is looking to boost that trend still further.\nInmarsat made worldwide news last year when its equipment aboard the lost Malaysia Airlines MH370 jet was able to direct investigators to a search zone in the Indian Ocean.\nThe London-based operator has subsequently proposed a free basic tracking service for all long-haul flights.\nGlobal Xpress sees the company take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.\nTraditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band, but this is becoming saturated.\nInmarsat says there is more opportunity to grow its business in Ka.\nThe higher frequency allows faster throughput connections, giving the I5s broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's fourth generation (I4) satellites.\nInmarsat's continued use of the Russian-built Proton is a show of faith in a rocket that has experienced a number of failures in recent years.\nThe rocket, which is marketed by US-based International Launch Services (ILS), was used to loft the I5-F1 in December 2013 and will be used again to send up the I5-F3, most probably in the second quarter on this year.\nMr Pinto said it was important for satellite operators that they had a choice of launch vehicles available to them, to open up schedules and keep prices low.\n\"ILS is gradually coming back to the launch market with an improving track record. We also have a SpaceX, which is up-and-coming and demonstrating its current and future hardware. And we have an Arianespace that is investing in an Ariane 6-class rocket to keep its place in the market. All those are developments that give us cause for cautious optimism.\"\nThe I5-F4 is regarded in the first instance as a back-up in case of a launch or in-orbit failure of any of the first three GX satellites, but it will eventually be launched.

{"document":"The non-binding proposal was approved at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in South Africa.\nConservationists hailed it as a significant step towards ending the current elephant poaching crisis.\nHowever Japan, which has a large domestic ivory trade, said the proposal did not apply there.\nWhile the international market in ivory has been closed since 1989, legal domestic markets have continued in many countries around the world.\nThere has been growing concern that domestic trading has encouraged the poaching of elephants.\nA surge in killing over the past seven years has seen populations across Africa shrink by a third, according to the recently published Great Elephant Census. What is driving the slaughter is the value of ivory, which can sell for around $1,100 (Â£850) per kilo in China.\nCountries including the US and China have announced plans to close their markets. The UK recently did the same, banning all trade in ivory dated from 1947 until the present day.\nTrade in materials from before 1947 will continue.\nWhile the nations attending this conference are divided on the best approach to protecting elephants, a compromise on the issue of closing domestic markets was arrived at after some heated discussions in a working group. However the measure then passed by consensus.\nThe agreed text calls is not legally binding and Cites can't compel countries to follow, but conservationists believe that it is a strong move as it is the first time that the 183 countries that have signed the Convention have taken a unified position on this question.\n\"It's an important step on the road to closing worldwide ivory markets. It's the first time that Cites has agreed to intervene so directly in domestic ivory,\" said Robert Hepworth, a former chair of the Cites standing committee.\nBecause it is a compromise, the new resolution does come with a significant caveat. It encourages countries to close their markets where those markets are \"contributing to poaching or illegal trade\".\nSome countries, including Japan are likely to argue that their markets don't contribute to poaching so they don't need to close them.\nSpeaking to the Japanese press, the country's environment minister expressed the view that the resolution wouldn't apply to Japan as there was no poached ivory in their market. Campaigners disagree vehemently.\n\"There is evidence that has shown that Japan's market has illegal ivory, fraudulent documents are used and there is ivory from illegal or unknown origins circulating in the market,\" said Iris Ho, from Humane Society International.\n\"It's very disappointing for the Japanese government to deny the existence of illegal ivory in their markets - Any legal market serves as a very convenient cover for illegal ivory to be laundered.\"\nWhat surprised many of the participants who drew up the resolution was the position taken by China, one of the biggest markets for illegal ivory.\nAccording to those involved, the Chinese were looking for an even stronger text on market closure.\n\"China wanted a very clear message that all domestic, legal markets should be closed,\" said Patrick Omondi who is part of the Kenyan delegation at Cites.\n\"The fact that they have recognised there's a problem with their domestic market and are working to close that market, is a very good signal for the conservation of the African elephant.\"\nThe unity displayed on the closure of markets may well be short-lived. Monday will see differing proposals on the future of elephants. Namibia and Zimbabwe are seeking to have elephants in their countries downgraded, paving the way for legitimate exports of ivory.\nA coalition of other African countries is proposing the very opposite. They want to upgrade all African elephants to the most protected status, removing any possibility of a commercial trade.\nThere is very likely to be a heated debate, and the feeling among observers is that neither proposal will command the two-thirds majority needed to alter the Convention.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.","summary":"Delegates at a UN wildlife conference have endorsed calls for the closure of all domestic ivory markets.","id":"37535717"}

{"document":"But being an editor isn't just an editorial job.\nThe editorial side of it is the most fulfilling and intellectually stimulating part, but it is only a part.\nThere are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties.\nLeadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there.\nIt has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it.\nFor instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one.\nGeorge Osborne to become Standard editor\nOsborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry\nGeorge Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor\nRead more from Amol\nAt organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations.\nAnd all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing.\nEditing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out.\nWhich pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again?\nWhen making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order.\nFirst, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper.\nSome would argue that there are other loyalties.\nAn editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills.\nBut those earlier loyalties are supreme.\nThey are very different to the loyalties required by political parties.\nI have never been a member of a political party, but I suspect those who have would say their loyalties aren't primarily to truth, readers, or newspaper reputations.\nA political party is an institution that organises its members to acquire and exercise legislative power.\nIts members have loyalty above all to that task. If they are committed, they wake up every day thirsting for power.\nOnce they have acquired it, fidelity to their tribe makes them determined not to relinquish it.\nQuite aside from the sheer practical workload, it is not easy to see how the loyalties required by editorship and the loyalties required by membership of a political party can be reconciled.\nThe latter long to inhabit the corridors of power. The former want to throw grenades at it.\nJournalism, at its best, is about the ferocious scrutiny of power.\nThat requires a certain distance from it. Of course, there are different types of journalism.\nI can see how it might be feasible for a theatre critic to be group secretary of his local Socialist Workers Party.\nI can also see how a brilliant football correspondent could be a member of the neo-Nazis.\nBut an editor, who has to conduct daily combat with politicians?\nIn being a member of the Conservative Party and, soon, editor of the London Evening Standard, George Osborne faces both practical and philosophical problems.\nThe practical one is when to sleep. The philosophical one is how to reconcile his clearly divided loyalties.\nWhich of his constituents matter most - those in Tatton, or his near-million readers at the Standard?\nHow does he cover, say, a Budget: as a loyal Conservative MP, or as a fearless editor?\nIt is hard enough to see how you reconcile being a member of a political party with being a journalist, let alone being an editor.\nHowever, being not only a member of a political party, but a sitting MP and a recent chancellor, as well as someone who retains political ambitions, is much tougher still.\nAnd that's before we even consider BlackRock. How can you cover the world of asset management while being paid ÃÂ£650,000 by it?\nThe idea that Mr Osborne could recuse himself from stories about that industry, or indeed the City pages altogether, strikes me as sub-optimal, to put it mildly: it would be bizarre to have a former chancellor as editor, only for him to have no involvement in business coverage.\nThese conflicts of interest are untenable, and so - as I said on Friday - I can't see it lasting.\nGiven his sources of income, he's much likelier to give up being an MP before he gives up having lunch at BlackRock.\nWhether it happens when Tatton disappears as a constituency, or before, I suspect he will be editor of the London Evening Standard after he is an MP in Cheshire.\nAs I mentioned in my previous posts, his task at the paper - setting out a clear strategy, improving the product, raising its profile, and turning the business around by finding new revenue streams - is one for which he has relevant experience and connections.\nThat said, it strikes me as a full-time job. Perhaps, therefore, Osborne hasn't fully grasped the function of an editor.\nI hope this post helps.","summary":"Editing a newspaper is an extremely rewarding and tough job, probably harder these days than a few decades ago, because of scarcity of resources and the demands of the internet.","id":"39325536"}

The vapour is considered potentially less harmful than cigarette smoke and is free of some damaging substances such as tar.\nIn October 2015, it became illegal for retailers to sell e-cigarettes to under-18s.\nThe operation, which was funded by the Department of Health, highlighted the wide variety of businesses supplying nicotine e-cigarettes and vaping liquids.\nMost of the illegal sales (68%) were made at markets and car boot sales.\nHigh levels of sales were also found at \"other\" premises, which included independent pharmacies, specialist e-cigarette shops and discount stores.\nFewest sales were made by national newsagents, petrol station kiosks and convenience stores, which are generally experienced in the sale of age restricted products and \"specifically in the principle of challenging a young person about their age and asking for proof\", the review said.\nThe operation found most of the vaping liquids were flavoured but some could be considered to be particularly \"child appealing\" - notably bubble gum, cherry cola and chocolate.\nTrading Standards said the figures should be seen against the results from a 2014 drug survey, which showed that while one fifth of 11-15 year-old respondents had used electronic cigarettes, only 1% were regular users of the products.\nLeon Livermore, chief executive at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said that while the results were disappointing it was important to consider them in context.\n\"More than 2.5 million adults use electronic cigarettes and evidence suggests the products are now the most popular quitting aid for smokers in England,\" he said.\n\"And these products are being sold in a wide variety of retailers and many of them will have little or no experience of challenging age restricted sales.\"\nHe said that where an illegal sale was made, further advice and guidance were given to help the business achieve compliance, but that penalties for the offence can be a fine of up to ÃÂ£2,500.\nNicola Blackwood, the public health minister, said there was strong support for restrictions from businesses when they were consulted, and added: \"As the school holidays are upon us, this is a timely reminder of their obligations under these regulations not to sell nicotine products to under 18 year olds.\"\nCommenting on the results of the operation, the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association said it welcomed the introduction of legislation to prohibit sales to under-18s and it was \"disappointing\" that compliance was \"so low\".\nChief Scientific Officer Tom Pruen said: \"While e-cigs offer the potential to save many lives by reducing the harm caused by smoking, it is important that they do not form a gateway into nicotine addiction for people, especially teenagers, who do not already use nicotine.\n\"Fortunately, while teenagers appear to be experimenting with vaping, this does not seem to be transferring into regular use, unlike with smoking.\n\"However, this is a genuine concern and one which requires careful monitoring, and responsible action from the industry at all levels.\"\nThe British Retail Consortium said: \"The sale of e-cigarettes and vaping liquids is regulated by law and is subject to the same levels of control as tobacco products.\n\"Every major retailer has rigorous policies and training practices, including awareness campaigns and till prompts, to ensure that the sale of such products is in full compliance with the law.\"","summary":"Almost 40% of sellers targeted in an operation by Trading Standards in England were caught illegally allowing under-18s to buy e-cigarette products.","id":"37007735"}

He is now an assistant manager in Sweden's second tier.\nNeil is ambitious, and has always indicated a desire to test himself at the highest level. So he was always likely to accept the offer to succeed Neil Adams at Carrow Road. Reid was his friend, but also the man who shaped his career.\nNeil was a right-back when he pitched up at Hamilton from Mansfield Town in 2005; Reid restored him to a holding midfield role because of two significant qualities: his tenacity and his ability to read the game.\nThose traits have served Neil well. He only became Hamilton player-manager in April 2013, when Reid stepped down. Since then, he has guided the club to promotion - via the play-offs last summer - and to an eye-catching campaign in the Premiership, which has included topping the table in October.\nFor perspective, no side in the top division has a lower wage budget. Hamilton regularly field a team in which half of the players have come through the youth ranks, and he led the team to their first win at Celtic Park since 1938.\nFollowing that 1-0 win, Neil gathered all of the players and club officials in the dressing room and urged them to make the most of the moment, and to build on it. The display and result were typical of Neil - not least because he was booked in the second half, while still amongst the substitutes.\nHe has a steely edge, and can occasionally be overly aggressive. That tends to generally be controlled, though, and the spikiness will be required as he tries to impose his authority on the Norwich squad. Many of the players will be around the same age as Neil - who is 33 - and most will have played at a higher level and earned more money from their careers.\nIn a world where wealth and kudos are commodities, Neil must find a way to display leadership and motivation without compromising his principles.\n\"He's very calm and won't be fazed,\" said the former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson, who regularly reports on Hamilton games for BBC Scotland and whose youngest son is a youth player at New Douglas Park.\n\"I did my B coaching badge with him. He has an edge and that's really important.\"\nThe victory over Celtic was also typical of Neil because he was not prepared to limit his players or alter his tactical approach. Reid would often make Hamilton more defensive when they played bigger clubs, but Neil urges his players to have belief in their abilities and to trust in their game plan.\nThe approach has worked, which is why Neil became Norwich's choice to replace Adams. Reid believes that his protege will succeed, remarking on him being \"grounded\" and that there is \"no chance he will be overawed by the challenge down there\".\nReid has also spoken about his decisions being challenged by Neil in the dressing room, but with his captain asking questions \"in the right way\". Reid tasked him with personally overseeing the development of James McCarthy and James McArthur, who broke through at Hamilton as teenagers and now play for Everton and Crystal Palace respectively.\nNeil will become the second youngest manager in the Football League. Norwich even had to technically sign him as a player, since his registration needed to be transferred to the Football Association from its Scottish counterpart. As a manager, he is clear-sighted and principled.\nHis Hamilton side played passing football, initiating swift, incisive counter attacks that were built upon well-organised and strategically shrewd tactics. Always in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with forward-thinking players out wide.\nAccies' approach is so ordered and sound that individuals can fit seamlessly into different positions because they all know what is expected of them.\nNeil, like all of the new generation of managers, relies on comprehensive analysis of his own team's performance and those of opponents. The Norwich players will be used to that kind of approach, but Neil does face challenges.\nAt Hamilton, he had coached the younger age group teams before becoming manager, so had worked with many of the players already. They were also well-versed in the club's style, and most were young, so open to technical coaching and instruction. The players at Norwich will be more established in their ways. Even so, Neil is a strong character.\n\"I'm a very secure person,\" Neil has said. \"I have very few insecurities in terms of confidence, speaking to a group and putting my message across.\n\"I don't mind demanding the most out of them or booting someone up the backside if I feel they aren't pulling their weight. All these sides to the job don't really bother me. It's something that comes naturally.\"\nLike Reid, he is able to inspire players. Neil has spoken of his willingness to risk long-term injury to play for Reid, and the guilt he felt whenever he wasn't playing for the team, because he felt he was personally letting Reid down. After the news broke that Norwich and Hamilton had agreed compensation, many of the players leaving New Douglas Park looked visibly shaken and upset.\nIt is a small, close-knit club and Neil made sure to know the partners and families of his players. He will have to adapt to the size and demands of Norwich, but he is good at sizing up challenges.\nFollowing Reid might have daunted lesser characters, but instead of trying to copy his predecessor, Neil altered Hamilton's approach, so that the players were more focused on their own playing style, rather than countering the tactics of the opposition.\nNeil also capably handled the challenges of combining playing and management. He was often Hamilton's best player, and understood how to juggle the two roles. He once fined himself for indiscipline on the field, by taking 24 players out for a three-course lunch.\nNeil is a talented and capable manager. His inexperience will test the limits of his potential, and the job at Norwich is of a very different stature to Hamilton, but in his own mind he is ready.","summary":"New Norwich City manager Alex Neil has learned from the successes and mistakes of his mentor.","id":"30737624"}

{"document":"The framework agreement, struck after intensive talks, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief.\nIran and the six world powers involved must now finalise the deal.\nIranians have been celebrating in the streets but Israel says the deal threatens its survival.\n\"This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb,\" the US President said in a statement after the deal was announced.\n\"If Iran cheats, the world will know it,\" he said, adding that the agreement was based not on trust but on \"unprecedented verification\". He said that if the deal is finalised, \"we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully\".\nAccording to \"parameters\" of the agreement published by the US state department, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium into a bomb by more than two-thirds.\nIt also has to redesign a power plant so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium, be subject to regular inspections, and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67% - far less than is required to make a nuclear bomb - for at least 15 years.\n\"There's new state of the art technology that will be used,\" US Secretary of State John Kerry told the BBC. \"We will have tracking of their uranium from the cradle to the grave.\"\nThere's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little.\nJohn Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb.\nAs hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place.\nA deal that buys time\nThe framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of intense negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne.\nWestern powers have long distrusted Iran's assertions that its nuclear programme is peaceful.\nThe talks at Lausanne's Beau-Rivage Palace hotel between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - continued beyond the original, self-imposed deadline of 31 March.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Javid Zarif, called it a \"win-win outcome\", but warned: \"We have taken a major step, but are still some way away from where we want to be.\"\nThe parties have set a deadline of 30 June to reach a comprehensive pact, but these negotiations are expected to be tougher than those that led to the framework agreement.\nEven so, there was jubilation overnight on the streets of Tehran.\nIf the deal is implemented it should mean the eventual lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.\nUnusually, the US President's speech was aired live on Iranian state television, with some Iranians taking \"selfies\" with Mr Obama as a backdrop.\nThere was anger though from Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Iran and told President Obama the deal threatened the survival of Israel.\nThe Israeli prime minister said it would \"increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war\", according to his spokesman.\nIn the US, the deal has been criticised by members of Congress who want US lawmakers to have the right to review any final agreement.\nUS House Speaker John Boehner said the deal represented an \"alarming departure\" from Mr Obama's original goals and that Congress should review the deal before sanctions on Iran were lifted.","summary":"President Obama has hailed a deal restricting Iran's nuclear programme as a \"historic understanding\" which, if implemented, will make world safer.","id":"32172301"}

{"document":"As African societies walk the tightrope between tradition and international law, some cultural practices which might be considered philanthropic at home can take on a very different complexion if transferred to the West.\nThey can even violate anti-slavery and human-trafficking laws.\nLike many African countries, Nigeria does not have a developed welfare state to look after its most deprived citizens.\nAn estimated 67% of the country's 170 million people live in poverty and they often rely on the generosity of relatives and philanthropists to provide their basic needs.\nAs a result, families with reasonable incomes immediately take on extra financial responsibilities to help out members of their extended family.\nThey will pay school fees for their grandmother's cousin's younger sister's nieces, medical bills for the stepsons of their uncle's wife's younger sister, and send money back to their home villages to fund classrooms, healthcare centres, or communal boreholes drilled to access drinking water.\nAlso, many poor families in the villages send their children to live with more comfortable families in the cities - usually as a \"house help\", who will clean, do laundry, cook, babysit and whatever else brawn can accomplish.\nIn exchange, the helps are fed, housed, clothed and if they're lucky, educated, with their parents sometimes receiving a fee.\nBut it is this ad-hoc welfare system that has been behind numerous allegations of human trafficking in Nigeria.\nAdaobi Tricia Nwaubani:\n\"It remains difficult for many Nigerians to agree that the arrangements they have with their domestic helps could be considered a crime\"\nDuring my childhood, my mother depended on the recommendations of people she knew in villages for those willing to become house helps - often they were teenagers sent by the their parents to earn extra money whilst attending school in the city.\nToday, there are \"agents\" who supply boys, girls, men and women, sometimes from poorer countries beyond Nigeria's borders, such as Benin and Togo.\nAgents usually demand between six months' to two years' worth of the worker's salary in advance, a percentage of which is sent to their families.\nThe typical wage is between 5,000 ($25, ÃÂ£16) and 15,000 naira per month. At those rates, the average middle-class Nigerian could afford to hire as many as they wanted.\nBut in the UK and US, where many Nigerians have made their homes, domestic staff have to be paid a minimum wage and all sorts of benefits.\nAs a result, some Nigerians abroad resort to importing domestic staff from \"back home\", sometimes with disastrous consequences.\nIn June 2011, Nigerian-American lawyer Bidemi Bello was convicted of human trafficking for bringing two Nigerian women to the US and \"forcing them to work in her lavish home like slaves\".\nThe court heard that Bello beat the women and failed to pay their wages.\nShe was sentenced by the Georgia court to 11 years in prison.\nAt the time the story broke, I was in charge of the opinion desk at a local newspaper, and keen to raise awareness of the issue back in Nigeria.\nI approached a number of potential contributors whom I felt could tackle the topic insightfully.\nNone was willing to write.\nBut some people were prepared to comment in private. They disapproved of Bello's conviction.\nHow, they asked, could these girls turn on Bello so viciously, after she had extended them such a huge favour of not just taking them in as her staff, but bringing them to the US?\nHow could they repay her generosity by plotting her ruin?\nA number of people shared experiences of those they knew in the UK or US, whose imported \"help\" had either got them in trouble with the law or almost done so.\nThey informed me that it was common for such workers to take advantage of the system in developed countries when their eyes opened to the laws of the new land, and of a way to free themselves from the snare of charity.\nIt was, their critics told me, their clever plan to exchange servitude for asylum, by becoming legitimate migrants who could then provide directly for their families.\nIn Nigeria, with no local laws to govern the house-help industry, domestic staff can work from dawn till dusk, Monday to Sunday.\nMany suffer abuse, of varying intensity, depending on their employer's temper.\nLocal newspapers have published stories of domestic workers who were drenched with boiling water or struck with a pestle.\nThere have also been allegations of sexual abuse of both male and female workers.\nNevertheless, it remains difficult for many Nigerians to agree that the arrangements they have with their domestic helps could be considered a crime.\nThey believe that the disadvantaged ones would have little hope without them, that the so-called slavery these people endure is simply a small price to pay for a chance at survival.\nMore from Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:","summary":"In our series of letters from African journalists, Nigerian novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani asks if using poorer relatives as domestic workers is helping them or exploiting them.","id":"34180122"}

{"document":"Luck was shining on Public Service Broadcasting when they came to writing the follow up to their 2013 debut album Inform-Educate-Entertain.\nThe band had previously worked with the British Film Institute in sourcing archive recordings to sample, and they turned to BFI again in their hunt for material from the Cold War space race.\n\"At the time I called them up to ask them if they had any space footage they'd only just inherited it from another collection,\" said J Willgoose.\n\"One of my biggest concerns about writing this album was about finding the material for the Soviet missions.\n\"It was an incredible stroke of luck that the BFI happened to come across these films just as I started asking after them.\"\nA fan of space exploration, Willgoose was familiar with the battles between the USA and USSR to beat one another to historic firsts.\nThe Soviets got the first satellite into space in the 1950s and the first man in the 1960s, while the Nasa's Apollo missions put the first men on the Moon.\nBut Willgoose was still surprised by what was in the BFI's newly-acquired collection.\nHe said: \"Most of the Soviet stuff was new to me - even now it's hard to find a great deal of good quality literature or footage of their missions because their space programme was shrouded in such secrecy.\n\"A good deal of the material from the Apollo missions I hadn't heard before - I really went very deep into the mission logs and dug out stuff that I hadn't heard of before.\n\"The public relations feed for the Apollo 8 lunar orbit was one of my favourite pieces of audio for the whole album.\"\nOne of the tracks on the new album - The Race for Space - is dedicated to cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. However, in a strange twist the music ended up evoking an American theme.\nWillgoose said: \"I'd had this guitar riff lying around for a couple of years as I'd tried to use it on another song and it hadn't worked, and it was always at the back of my mind because I really liked it.\n\"Then when it came to matching up musical ideas that I'd had with likely topics for the album, and having watched the footage of Gagarin's reception on returning to Earth, it seemed to make sense to me in quite an attractively odd and incongruous way.\n\"It seemed like a strange song to write about him, and a very non-literal one, which appealed to me.\n\"We treat the source material in different ways on different songs across the album but I loved the idea of making him a pseudo-70s cop show soundtrack and trying to capture some of the exuberance and euphoria I saw on film.\n\"The original riff ended up being almost totally re-written in the process, and then the brass came on board, so it moved on quite a lot from the original germ of an idea.\"\nPSB first worked with BFI on 2012's five-track EP The War Room. The record was based on a series of old propaganda films and archive material.\nThe EP was dedicated to a great uncle of Willgoose who died at Dunkirk in May 1940.

{"document":"Seventeen student bodies have endorsed the BDS movement - which calls for an international boycott of Israel over the way it treats Palestinians.\nSome Jewish students in the UK say growing support for BDS has fuelled a rise in anti-Semitism on campuses.\nThe Commission said it would assess the concerns and take action if necessary.\nThe BDS - which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions - describes itself as a human rights organisation and criticises Israel for its human rights record.\nIt says it stands for \"freedom, justice and equality\", saying it is \"inclusive and categorically opposes as a matter of principle all forms of racism\" - including anti-Semitism.\nDevora Khafi, a student at Queen Mary University of London, is one of nearly 10,000 Jewish students in the UK.\nShe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she felt physically intimidated when other students hijacked a speech at London's UCL given by a former Israeli defence force officer.\nShe said she was pushed against some doors, jostled and shouted at by protesters.\nShe says she fears having a connection with Israel has made other people at her university hostile towards her.\n\"If I ever express a viewpoint in class or on social media, I get comments, in public or private,\" she said.\n\"It has been hard. It's been two years of constant fighting for our freedom of speech, our rights, our wellbeing. I've missed deadlines, I've had counselling, I've had anxiety episodes,\" she said.\nDevora believes the BDS movement is adding to a climate of hostility against Israel on campus, which she says has turned her and other Jewish students into scapegoats.\n\"If you look behind the BDS lens, it calls for these things that are not peaceful. They harm Jewish students and pro-Israel students and they don't support a peaceful, atmosphere on campus.\"\nSupport for BDS has been growing rapidly on British campuses.\nLondon's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) students' union in London was one of the first to endorse the BDS, after students voted in favour in a referendum in 2015.\nThe students' union implemented an academic boycott of Israel.\nThe BBC found 17 students' unions have now passed motions to endorse the BDS boycott of Israel.\nThey include Belfast, Birkbeck, Brunel, Essex, Exeter, Goldsmiths, Kings College London, Kingston, Lancashire, Liverpool, Manchester, SOAS, Strathclyde, Sussex, Swansea, University of Arts London and UCL.\nBut it is possible they may be breaking the law by backing the movement.\nSince 2010, students' unions have become registered charities, meaning they have a legal duty to represent the interests of their members.\nAccording to guidance, public comment should also be limited to matters that affect the welfare of the union's members as students.\nThe BBC understands these issues have been raised with the Charity Commission, which is assessing them to determine if any regulatory action should be taken.\nA Charity Commission spokesperson said concerns about links to the BDS Movement would be \"assessed consistently\" and, where appropriate, it would \"take regulatory action\".\nDavid Holdsworth, from the commission, said students' unions must not be discriminatory towards students \"of a particular faith or race\".\nIsaac Bentata, a student at UCL, said there were times when he didn't feel comfortable expressing his views as a Jewish student.\n\"During my first week at university all I saw were BDS stickers\", he explained.\nHe said he was accused of being a \"Mossad agent\" after speaking up at one BDS event.\n\"As we left the event we saw that we were being followed by this guy and we had to run to the station because we'd heard about him being particularly hostile,\" he added.\n\"I thought, 'this is not how I'm supposed to be feeling because I asked questions during a debate at a university'.\"\nBoth the NUS and the BDS National Committee declined to comment to the BBC.\nOf the students' unions we contacted, only SOAS provided us with a response.\nIts co-president, Ayesha Abbasi, said it was a \"democratic organisation\" and followed \"democratic decision-making processes.\"\n\"We have had no formal complaints of anti-Semitism or bullying from any Jewish students since the BDS referendum,\" she added.\nSai Englert, a Jewish PHD student at SOAS and a member of the university's Palestine Society, said: \"The idea that somehow supporting BDS, supporting boycott etc is a blanket boycott on individuals I think is very dangerous.

The NICE guidelines, which cover England and Wales, only discuss treating women.\nBotox treatment is thought to help dampen chemical messages that your bladder uses to tell the brain that you need to urinate.\nThe injections are administered directly to the bladder wall via a small device inserted into the urethra - the tube you urinate through.\nClinical trials suggest this treatment may last for up to six months, but NICE says people also need to be aware of the possible side-effects.\nThe treatment can make it more difficult to pass urine and some people may find they need to use a catheter for a time. There is also a chance of getting a urine infection.\nAnyone who starts on this treatment should have a face-to-face check up or be reviewed over the phone within four weeks, says NICE.\nProf Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: \"Urinary incontinence is a distressing condition affecting the lives of millions of women of all ages.\n\"While rarely life-threatening, it may seriously influence a woman's physical, psychological and social wellbeing.\n\"Over the years we have seen an increase in women seeking treatment, yet many others are still suffering in silence and not receiving the appropriate care for their condition.\n\"This updated clinical guideline suggests a range of treatments that women should be able to access to limit the distress that urinary incontinence can cause.\"","summary":"Botox injections can now be offered as a treatment for urinary incontinence, says England's NHS drugs watchdog.","id":"24029518"}

{"document":"Sir Norman Bettison was responding to calls for his resignation over the statement he published on Thursday.\nSir Norman said he had not intended to suggest Liverpool fans had hindered police during the disaster in April 1989 in which 96 people died.\nLiverpool fans were \"in no way to blame\" for the disaster, he said.\nSir Norman said he was sorry if he had \"caused any further upset\".\nWest Yorkshire Police Authority had earlier referred Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy to a special committee for investigation.\nThe chief constable was coming under mounting pressure to resign after releasing the statement suggesting Liverpool fans made the job of the police more difficult on the day of the tragedy.\nOn 15 April 1989, the former South Yorkshire officer was an off-duty inspector at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium, which was hosting an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.\nIn his original statement, Sir Norman said: \"Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be.\"\nJohn Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said many of his constituents were at the game and had called for Sir Norman to resign.\n\"After the statement he made when he seemed to have a go again at Liverpool fans, I think his position is untenable. He has got to go.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Sir Norman's comments were \"insensitive and ill-judged\".\nIn a fresh statement, Sir Norman said: \"The fans of Liverpool Football Club were in no way to blame for the disaster that unfolded at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.\"\nThat view had been formed after hearing all the evidence presented at the Taylor inquiry into the tragedy, said Sir Norman.\n\"The evidence was overwhelming. The police failed to control the situation, which ultimately led to the tragic deaths of 96 entirely innocent people. I can be no plainer than that.\"\nSir Norman said he was \"sorry if my earlier statement, intended to convey the same message, has caused any further upset\".\nThe aim was not to \"besmirch the fans\", he said, and he was \"deeply sorry that impression and slight has lingered for 23 years\".","summary":"West Yorkshire's Chief Constable has apologised for any upset caused by a statement he issued about his role in the Hillsborough tragedy.","id":"19602577"}
