{"text": "Question: How would one describe the control of universities before nation-states in the 17th century? Context: The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What rival group did the Anglican Puritans want purged from their area? Context: Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659, 1660, and 1661. These executions resulted from the actions of the Anglican Puritans, who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At the time, the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a \"purer absolute theocracy\" within their colony .[citation needed] As such, they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived \"heresies\".[citation needed] It should be noticed that the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox communions generally regard the Puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "The review, led by businesswoman Julie Deane, is calling for them to have similar rights to company employees, such as enhanced maternity privileges.\nThe report said that self-employed people now stood at 4.6 million or 15% of the UK workforce, an all-time high.\nIt said self-employment \"should not mean that people are disadvantaged\".\n\"It is important that with the increased growth in self-employment, and the subsequent benefits that this group brings to the economy, that there are systems in place to support the self-employed in the same way as the employed,\" the report added.\nIn particular, the report called on the government to consider increasing the maternity allowance paid to self-employed people for the first six weeks, bringing it into line with the statutory maternity pay that employees receive.\n\"As is the case with Statutory Maternity Pay, the remaining 33 weeks would be paid at the lower of the statutory flat rate or 90% of earnings,\" it said.\nIt also called for a new Adoption Allowance for self-employed people who adopt children, on the same basis as the existing statutory adoption pay for employees.\n\"The support provided by government to those starting or extending a family should be consistent whether the beneficiary is employed or self-employed,\" the report said.\nSome analysts have suggested that many of the newly self-employed are people who have lost their jobs as a result of the recent financial crisis and would prefer to work for an employer.\nHowever, Ms Deane's report said the majority of self-employed people had made \"a positive choice to be so\" and had \"no plans to return to employment\".\n\"They have found a good balance with work/life commitments and are often happier,\" it added.\nJames Gribben, of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed, agreed with the report's findings.\nHe told the BBC: \"What we would like to see ideally is paternal leave.
