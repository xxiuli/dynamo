We've got to go out there with ambition - there's no point in sitting on our heels and hoping you're going to have a physical confrontation with them.\n\"You've got to be willing to play and expand and really take the game to them as well. So I think for us it's just about getting as much detail as possible on the field, and once we've got that detail making sure it's second nature.\"\nOnly 14 of the 41 players selected by Gatland have reported to the Vale of Glamorgan for the first week of training - the rest remain embroiled in the latter stages of domestic competitions with their respective club sides.\n\"Guys have done very well at their clubs and are playing in semi-finals and finals, they're rightly where they should be,\" Seymour said.\n\"You want everyone together, but we've had a really successful week, we've had enough numbers to be able to accomplish a lot of stuff. We've been able to tick a lot of boxes, and get a lot of things across that will give us a good head start going into the weeks to come.\n\"We've had a guy in every position as well, so even when it comes down to patterns and things rugby-wise, that's been able to be accomplished as well.\n\"I think it'll help to get everyone integrated as quickly as possible because there will be guys dotted around the field that can kind of explain what's going on and point everyone in the right direction. It'll help the coaches as well to get everyone embedded as quickly as possible.\"\nSeymour has been joined by compatriots Stuart Hogg and Greig Laidlaw, who was a pre-tour replacement for England's Ben Youngs.\nSome Scottish pundits, including former coach Jim Telfer, have aired their grievances at the paucity of Scots in the squad, but American-born Seymour insists he is focusing solely on forging strong bonds with his new team-mates.\n\"That question's been asked a lot, but I'm in my Lions head now,\" Seymour added. \"I need to get familiar and bed into relationships with guys here. That's my focus right now, it's not about what's not here.\n\"I feel like you guys [in the media] want me to have an answer to the Scottish thing. You don't enter the meeting room or the team room and think, there's a Scotsman, there's an Englishman, there's an Irishman, there's a Welshman.\n\"It can't work like that. If you go in with that mind-set, then you're already on the back foot, you're already creating lines where there doesn't need to be any. We go into the meeting room and we think, 'there's another squad member, another part of this playing group'.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "Tommy Seymour admits the British and Irish Lions must be willing to suffer if they are to win a series in New Zealand for the first time since 1971."}

{"document": "\"He was someone who knew how to express himself both with music and with fashion,\" Japanese designer Kansai Yamamoto told the BBC.\n\"Someone like that may not be so rare these days, but he was one of the pioneers to do both.\"\nMr Yamamoto, the creative force behind some of Bowie's most iconic stage outfits, first got to know Bowie in the 1970s, when the singer was often visiting Japan, and trying to break into the US market.\n\"I don't know why he was so attracted to things Japanese, but perhaps it wasn't so much Japan or Japanese-ness itself. He knew when he looked good in something.\n\"When you wear something and you look really good... you feel confident and good about yourself. I think my designs and costumes had that effect on him.\"\nHelene Thian, a fashion historian and lifelong fan who has written extensively about Bowie, agreed. She said Bowie had often been noted as having had \"this beautiful androgynous face and body, which suited Kansai Yamamoto's unisex style\".\nBowie's Japanese style had already been developing through his interest in Japanese theatre.\nIn the mid-1960s, he studied dance with Lindsay Kemp, a British performance and mime artist who was heavily influenced by the traditional kabuki style, with its exaggerated gestures, elaborate costumes, striking make-up, and \"onnagata\" actors - men playing female roles.\nBowie was a natural \"shapeshifter\", says Ms Thian, and his training with Kemp and onnagata style helped him as he explored ideas of masculinity, exoticism and alienation.\nHe even learned from famed onnagata Tamasaburo Bando how to apply traditional kabuki make-up - its bold highlighted features on a white background are evident in the lightning bolt across the Ziggy face.\n\"It wasn't trying to be literal interpretation\" of onnagata, said Ms Thian, \"but rather inspired by its gender-bending androgyny. That's what makes it so powerful, it's more evocative.\"\nMr Yamamoto said he wasn't sure why he and Bowie had such an affinity, but that \"something resonated between us, something that went beyond nationalities, beyond gender\".\nThrough his style and performances, he said, Bowie \"broke one sexual taboo after another\".\n\"What he did in terms of bridging the male-female gap continues to this day,\" he said, including in the increasing acceptance of gay relationships in Japan.\nAmong his most famous outfits for Bowie was Space Samurai, a black, red and blue outfit adapting the hakama, a type of loose trousers which samurais wore and which are still worn by martial arts practitioners.\nHe also sometimes wore a kimono-inspired cape with traditional Japanese characters on it which spell out his name phonetically, but also translate to \"fiery vomiting and venting in a menacing manner\".\nMs Thian says Bowie was also \"absolutely the first\" Western artist to employ the hayagawari - literally \"quick change\" - technique from kabuki, says Ms Thian, with unseen stagehands ripping off the dramatic cape on stage to reveal another outfit.\nIt wasn't just his appearance - references to Japan are scattered through Bowie's music - his 1977 album Heroes even features the track Moss Garden on which he plays a Japanese koto, a kind of zither.\nThese days, an artist in Bowie's position might be accused of cultural appropriation - stealing another culture for his own purposes - but Ms Thian says it was never seen that way in Japan.\n\"Bowie was born to be the ultimate diplomat and artiste,\" she says.\n\"He took his creativity and fused it with his impulses to meld East and West and come up with a healing of the world in this post-war period.\"\nThis was \"a homage to Japanese culture and the Japanese loved it\", she said, as Bowie challenged the tendency of Western fashion at the time to lump all Asian styles together as \"Orientalism\".\nIndeed, Japan embraced Bowie back, and he remains an icon there, with his glam rock style influencing generations of bands and musicians.\nRenowned rock guitarist Hotei Tomayasu, best known outside  Japan for composing the theme for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films, told the BBC: \"[Bowie] is the one who truly changed my life. My eternal hero and inspiration.\"\nBowie is also known in Japan for his role as Maj Jack Celliers in the 1983 iconic film Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, directed by the renowned Nagisa Oshima.\nThe film, set during World War Two in a Japanese camp for prisoners, pits Bowie's character and another soldier against two Japanese officers, one of whom is played by the famous musician Ryuichi Sakamoto.\nOn Twitter, Sakamoto's ex-wife Akiko Yano recalled how Bowie carried their young daughter - Miu - on his shoulders when the family visited the Roppongi neighbourhood in Tokyo with Bowie in the 1980s.\nMiu Sakamoto tweeted this picture of herself as a little girl shaking hands with the singer, saying she vaguely recalled meeting \"a very beautiful man\".\n\"(He is) no more.

But it turns out that this isn't going to be a problem.\n\"I'm not going to direct [any plays], so nobody needs to worry about that,\" she says. \"I think it's a skill that I don't have, I think it's a particular skill, and my passion is acting.\"\nSo much so, that Terry plans to take to the stage herself pretty soon.\n\"Being part of an ensemble is part of my first season's plans, and it's really important to me that I am part of that ensemble.\n\"I think for me that's what creates the best Shakespeare, collaboration in this space with the artists, with the audience, that's where you get the meaning making, that you're in a collective imaginative space.\"\nForthcoming productions at the Globe will have equal roles for men and women.\n\"The whole season will be 50/50, and that's not just small parts played by women or men,\" Terry says.\n\"Across the season, the body of work will have equal amounts for male, female, it will be gender blind, race blind, disability blind.\n\"I have benefitted from that being a possibility. When I played Henry V [last summer], we had Brexit, the Chilcot inquiry, Theresa May as prime minister - these are all things that serve that play, and me being a woman was the last thing on people's minds. So I know it works.\n\"And also, Shakespeare didn't worry about gender - he had men playing women - so I don't know why we have to worry about it.\"\nHave the outgoing and incoming directors had any contact?\n\"We've met. I met her as part of the application process, we've had cups of tea,\" Terry says.\n\"Most people that work in theatre are freelancers, nobody is part of the building, we all sort of move on. So it really is a community venture, so there's never any... people will talk about there being competition but for me it's a collaborative process.\"\nShe adds: \"You know Emma's work, if you've seen Kneehigh [the theatre in Cornwall that Rice was the artistic director of] you know what she does.\n\"So part of that was going, 'Does that work in here?'

It remains open, run by Cumbria Zoo Company Ltd, pending an appeal against the decision not to grant an operating licence.\nFiona McClay believes the zoo should be closed for now  - although not, perhaps, indefinitely.\nIn the meantime, she lives with the memory of a child who had grown up to become a friend, sharing secrets - but whose potential was cut short by one of the creatures she loved.\n\"When people say when you lose child, they lose a part of their life, it's absolutely true.\n\"It's not to say that every day I'm in tears and every moment I'm thinking about Sarah but there are times every day when I think 'I should have told Sarah that'.\"\nThe BBC contacted David Gill's solicitor about Fiona McClay's comments. He said his client was unwilling to offer any comment on any matter relating to the zoo while the licence was under the legal and regulatory process.\nThe current operator of the zoo, Cumbria Zoo Company Ltd, issued the following statement: \"We have work to do, we know we do.  A modern zoo should continually strive to be better in all it does.\n\"We are pushing hard to meet our goals, without compromise to achieve high standards for the animals in our care and for our staff and local community and we drive forward to earn Safari Zoo its place in the modern zoo community.

{"document": "Sampson was absolved of wrongdoing after striker Eniola Aluko made a complaint to the Football Association (FA) about \"bullying and harassment\".\nShe claimed Sampson said an unnamed player would have been arrested several times because she was of mixed race.\nBut the FA said an independent report found no evidence to support that.\nOn Thursday, the governing body published a summary of the report's findings - in the form of a letter to Chelsea player Aluko - written by the barrister who conducted the review.\nKatharine Newton wrote that she was \"sure\", having seen video evidence of the team meeting at which Aluko claimed the alleged racial abuse took place, that \"at no point on that video is the alleged comment made\".\nNewton's letter to Aluko also states that:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAllegations made by Aluko include her being described as \"lazy\", Sampson belittling her in front of the squad, and what she said are \"false claims\" by the coach of \"bad behaviour\".\nIn a statement released by the FA on Thursday, 34-year-old Sampson said he \"fully understood and welcomed the need for an internal review\".\nHe added: \"It's incredibly important that matters like this are taken extremely seriously and investigated in the right way - with the right level of sensitivity and support for all involved.\n\"The barrister's final report said there was no case to answer and noted that my approach to all players is the same regardless of their background.\n\"I also appreciated that the report highlighted areas where I could improve my general communication style, and that is something I have taken on board and looked to improve.\"\nAluko, who has scored 33 goals in 102 England appearances, received about £80,000 in a settlement with the FA.\nThe governing body described it as \"a mutual resolution\" to avoid disrupting the England squad's preparations for Women's Euro 2017, which ended in a semi-final defeat by the Netherlands.\nSince making the complaint, Aluko has not been picked for England and last played for her country in April 2016, despite being the Women's Super League One top scorer the same year.\nHowever, she still remains a centrally contracted player on a deal worth about £30,000 a year.\nA qualified lawyer, Aluko was part of the England team who won the bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup and became the first female pundit to appear on Match of the Day.\nBBC Sport correspondent Natalie Pirks\nIn early 2016, the FA's director of elite development Dan Ashworth asked Aluko to be part of a cultural review of all England teams.

{"document": "That is particularly true around the thorny and politically toxic issue of aviation.\nThe government has said it will make a decision by the end of the month on its preferred option for expansion at either Gatwick, or a new or extended runway at Heathrow.\nWhile the expansion hawks want a new runway at Heathrow now - whatever the government's decision next week - the process up to construction will not be quick.\nThe previous Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, outlined last February to the Transport Select Committee what would happen once a decision was made.\nHe said: \"...there will be a draft National Policy Statement (NPS) published for consultation and laid in Parliament. This is published a minimum of four weeks after the announcement on the runway location to avoid the legal risk of pre-determination.\n\"There is no decision yet on the length of the public consultation, but it could be 16 weeks. A Commons Select Committee will examine the draft NPS and hold a full-blown inquiry for 12 weeks immediately following the public consultation.\n\"The Commons Select Committee will submit a report to me by the end of the 12-week period. Once a final NPS is laid, debates and votes must happen within 21 sitting days of the House. At any time after the vote, or it could be the same day, if there is a negative vote, the Secretary of State will change and lay a new NPS, again for 21 voting days.\"\nSo, there will be around a year before Parliament gets a vote on that National Policy Statement. The Government will be expected to address concerns over noise and pollution.\nAnd it is then, and only then, that it enters the planning process.\nFirst the developer submits a development to the planning inspectorate. Then there is a planning inquiry over six months. Then the planning inspector reports to the Secretary of State within three months.\nAnd finally the Secretary of State will consider the report and announce a decision within a further three months.\nSo an actual \"final\" announcement could be two years from the initial Government decision - and that is with a fair wind.\nThere will be gaps and delays in the process, there are those who think two years is the absolute minimum and the reality is it will take at least four years before a \"final decision\".\nNone of the timescales include the legal challenges that could slow down the process further. (Bear in mind this is meant to be a quicker process than was in place previously).\nHistory tells us how difficult it is to build new runways in the South East and how strong the opposition is.\nThere have been many inquiries, commissions and consultations. Plans have come and gone. There have been proposals at Cublington in Buckinghamshire, Maplin Sands in the Estuary, Stansted and the previous Northern runway at Heathrow.\nAll fell off the table during the long process as the politics shifted.

This is published a minimum of four weeks after the announcement on the runway location to avoid the legal risk of pre-determination.\n\"There is no decision yet on the length of the public consultation, but it could be 16 weeks. A Commons Select Committee will examine the draft NPS and hold a full-blown inquiry for 12 weeks immediately following the public consultation.\n\"The Commons Select Committee will submit a report to me by the end of the 12-week period. Once a final NPS is laid, debates and votes must happen within 21 sitting days of the House. At any time after the vote, or it could be the same day, if there is a negative vote, the Secretary of State will change and lay a new NPS, again for 21 voting days.\"\nSo, there will be around a year before Parliament gets a vote on that National Policy Statement. The Government will be expected to address concerns over noise and pollution.\nAnd it is then, and only then, that it enters the planning process.\nFirst the developer submits a development to the planning inspectorate. Then there is a planning inquiry over six months. Then the planning inspector reports to the Secretary of State within three months.\nAnd finally the Secretary of State will consider the report and announce a decision within a further three months.\nSo an actual \"final\" announcement could be two years from the initial Government decision - and that is with a fair wind.\nThere will be gaps and delays in the process, there are those who think two years is the absolute minimum and the reality is it will take at least four years before a \"final decision\".\nNone of the timescales include the legal challenges that could slow down the process further. (Bear in mind this is meant to be a quicker process than was in place previously).\nHistory tells us how difficult it is to build new runways in the South East and how strong the opposition is.\nThere have been many inquiries, commissions and consultations. Plans have come and gone. There have been proposals at Cublington in Buckinghamshire, Maplin Sands in the Estuary, Stansted and the previous Northern runway at Heathrow.\nAll fell off the table during the long process as the politics shifted.

The IDF is reviewing the incident,\" it said.\nThe UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says a 3km (1.9 mile) wide strip, encompassing 44% of Gaza, has been designated as a no-go zone by the Israeli military.\nIsrael imposed restrictions on the Gaza Strip in 2006, after Hamas abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\nThe measures were tightened by Israel and Egypt in 2007, after Hamas ousted rival Fatah and forcibly took control in Gaza after winning elections the year before.\nHamas and Fatah announced a reconciliation deal in April, but the move was condemned by Israel which regards Hamas as a terrorist group.\nIsrael's Science Minister Yaakov Peri told Israeli web portal Walla that he did not see a ceasefire being agreed in the coming days, as the IDF needed more time to dismantle Hamas' underground tunnel network.\nBut in his BBC interview, Mr Meshaal was critical of the way Israel targeted Palestinian homes in aerial bombardments, saying a three-minute signal to leave - one of Israel's warning measures - was not a \"proper warning\".\n\"A Palestinian has built this home with his money. Are Israelis expecting him to leave just like that?\"\nHe said Israel was unable to reach the underground rocket launchers, belonging \"to the resistance\".\n\"This is why it pretends that they are in civilian areas so Israel is hitting hospitals mosques, towers and buildings,\" the militant leader said.\nPalestinian medical sources said the death toll in Gaza had risen to 797 on Thursday. Of these, 191 were children and 67 were women, officials said.\nIsrael says 31 soldiers, two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker in the Israeli city of Ashkelon have been killed since 8 July.\nThousands of Palestinians also took part in a protest in the West Bank against Israel's military offensive.\nAt least two were killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire, and doctors said hundreds were also injured.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "At least 13 people were killed and more than 200 injured when a UN-run school used as a shelter came under fire in Gaza, health officials say."}

It is the first time we have been 1-1 at half-time and we spoke of how we had to be like a team and in the second half we played really well.\n\"Sergio is quality. His first step, second step in the box is so good and that is why he is one of the best strikers in the world but I want to help him improve his game.\"\nOn De Bruyne, Guardiola added: \"I think he is injured, that's why we have to have a big squad as everyone will help us.\n\"It's a pity - he is important for us. How he reacted, it looks like it was a muscular injury, but I'm not a doctor.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSwansea City manager Francesco Guidolin said: \"We played a very good game and for one hour we were at the same level as Manchester City and they are the best team in the UK.\n\"In front of us we have a good future. I know my job and after four, five or six defeats it it not easy but I am confident as we have played a good game today.\"\nOn the penalty decision that saw his side fall 2-1 behind, Guidolin added: \"I'm not a judge. If the referee says this I have to accept it. For me it is not a penalty but that's not important, the important thing is my team played a good game.\"\nSwansea take on Liverpool at home on Saturday, 1 October in the Premier League (12:30 BST).

{"document": "Last month, it hit the headlines again when six people were killed in the space of just two days.\nAmong them was a 10-year-old boy shot dead by police who allegedly mistook his mobile phone for a gun.\nThe spike in violence comes less than five years after police special forces moved into the favela to retake it from the drug gangs which had been running it for years.\nThe narrow and winding streets of Complexo do Alemao, which house an estimated 70,000 people, were thought to be inaccessible to security forces.\nSo when aerial TV footage showed scores of drug dealers fleeing the favela on foot and motorcycles it was seen as a major turning point in Rio's struggle against organised crime.\nThe security forces established a permanent presence in the neighbourhood as part of their policy to \"pacify\" Rio's favelas, but over the past months shootouts between drug gangs and the police have again become commonplace.\nBeth McLoughlin spoke to four residents about what it is like to live in Complexo do Alemao.\n\"I love this place, but I have often thought about moving away.\n\"I used to work as a motorbike taxi driver, but I had to give it up because it was too dangerous when there were gunfights. I was responsible not just for me but for my passenger as well.\n\"You hear a lot of gossip as a motorbike taxi driver. A woman got me to take her to a house because her husband was there with another woman.\n\"You get to know everyone.\n\"I have lost a lot of friends to the drug gangs. It's difficult when people you grow up with die.\n\"I chose a different path. My brother died after he got shot in a police operation. It makes you stronger in one way, but in another way, you are crying inside.\n\"My mother gets ill because of the shootouts, but I'm used to it. I've started my own business now, selling food inside the community.\"\n\"When I was growing up here, we used to play in the street freely.\n\"It was the opposite to what people think a favela is like. There weren't so many guns around in those days.\n\"At Barraco 55 [community centre], we have music practices and there is a hostel so foreigners can bring their skills to the community.\n\"It's a way of showing the good things about the community to people.\n\"Before the army came, I believed it could make things better. A lot of things were promised.\n\"Now, we have a health centre but most of the time there are no doctors, because they are too afraid [to come to the favela].\n\"When teachers don't come to the schools, classes get cancelled, and those children end up on the streets where there is more chance they will work for drug gangs.\n\"Last year, I was coming back from a class, and I had to hide behind a car because of a shootout. It's a horrible situation.\n\"But residents get used to this routine, they just carry on with their daily lives.\"\n\"In the favela we like to celebrate, but the police banned our baile funk [dance] parties, I think they don't like to see people in favelas having fun.\n\"Now, we have to ask them if we want to hold an event. Sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say no.\n\"In 2007, no one would set foot in Complexo do Alemao. I set up an IT company to bring internet to people, but we couldn't even get the communications companies to come in.\n\"Post still doesn't get delivered to a lot of houses. You have to pick it up at the residents' association, or give the address of a relative.\n\"Postmen are afraid to enter because of the gunfights.\n\"I've never hidden from people where I live.

I was responsible not just for me but for my passenger as well.\n\"You hear a lot of gossip as a motorbike taxi driver. A woman got me to take her to a house because her husband was there with another woman.\n\"You get to know everyone.\n\"I have lost a lot of friends to the drug gangs. It's difficult when people you grow up with die.\n\"I chose a different path. My brother died after he got shot in a police operation. It makes you stronger in one way, but in another way, you are crying inside.\n\"My mother gets ill because of the shootouts, but I'm used to it. I've started my own business now, selling food inside the community.\"\n\"When I was growing up here, we used to play in the street freely.\n\"It was the opposite to what people think a favela is like. There weren't so many guns around in those days.\n\"At Barraco 55 [community centre], we have music practices and there is a hostel so foreigners can bring their skills to the community.\n\"It's a way of showing the good things about the community to people.\n\"Before the army came, I believed it could make things better. A lot of things were promised.\n\"Now, we have a health centre but most of the time there are no doctors, because they are too afraid [to come to the favela].\n\"When teachers don't come to the schools, classes get cancelled, and those children end up on the streets where there is more chance they will work for drug gangs.\n\"Last year, I was coming back from a class, and I had to hide behind a car because of a shootout. It's a horrible situation.\n\"But residents get used to this routine, they just carry on with their daily lives.\"\n\"In the favela we like to celebrate, but the police banned our baile funk [dance] parties, I think they don't like to see people in favelas having fun.\n\"Now, we have to ask them if we want to hold an event. Sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say no.\n\"In 2007, no one would set foot in Complexo do Alemao. I set up an IT company to bring internet to people, but we couldn't even get the communications companies to come in.\n\"Post still doesn't get delivered to a lot of houses. You have to pick it up at the residents' association, or give the address of a relative.\n\"Postmen are afraid to enter because of the gunfights.\n\"I've never hidden from people where I live.

{"document": "The DUP's Jonathan Bell claimed Arlene Foster's advisers tried to remove her name from emails linked to the scheme. They deny any wrongdoing.\nMrs Foster set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in 2012, but overgenerous subsidies meant the more claimants burned, the more they earned.\nShe has told BBC News NI if documents were altered \"it wasn't on my say-so\".\nPolitical parties have been quick to respond to the unfolding scandal:\n\"The interviews given by the first minister and Jonathan Bell raise more questions than they answer. They are internally inconsistent, as well as conflicting with each other.\n\"We believe that an independent judge-led inquiry may now be the only means of establishing the objective facts in a manner which is capable of restoring public confidence in the devolved institutions.\n\"At the very least, the first minister should step aside for the duration of that investigation and all paperwork and correspondence relating to RHI should be released publicly as we have previously stated.\"\n\"I think she (Mrs Foster) should step aside for a period.\n\"The only way we can find out the truth now is if all the documents that have been referenced to are put into the public domain.\n\"The most important thing things to know are who designed this scheme, why was it designed differently to the British scheme, who benefited from the scheme and at how many different points could this scheme have been stopped.\n\"I think we are now in the realm of some sort of a public inquiry - the public desperately need some confidence put back into our institutions.\"\n\"An adviser is there to advise, you can show the adviser the door any time you want.\n\"A minister is there to make the decisions - special advisers don't make the decisions.\n\"I don't believe that there is any need for a public inquiry.\"\n\"(I have been) one of the few people in the assembly who ever challenged the way in which we have bowed down to this green guff.\"\n\"Duplicity in politics is never pleasant. So, it is good to see it exposed.\n\"What Jonathan Bell did would not have been easy, because for years he has been an insider in a party where control freakery is its modus operandi.

It is estimated that the Lions turn over about $50m (Â£39m) in each four-year cycle between tours.\nMeanwhile, some 35,000 fans are expected to make the journey from around the world, with close to half buying packages from the in-house travel operator, Lions Rugby Travel.\nThis commercial power of the tour, which takes in 10 games - including three Test matches against the All Blacks - means it will generate significant revenues for the development of the sport in the UK and Ireland.\n\"The value of the Lions is actually so much greater than what you might see on a tour. It is the fusion of the professional and amateur eras, it embodies all the good qualities of the game,\" Charlie McEwen, British and Irish Lions chief operating officer, tells me.\n\"And that means that supporting and growing the presence of rugby union is a very important part of what we do.  The Lions is a subsidiary of the four home rugby unions and any profits are distributed back to the home unions, with the ultimate aim of growing the game.\"\nAs part of that mission, at the end of March the Lions also unveiled its own separate grassroots programme. It will see some of the money they raise go directly into a standalone Lions-directed programme.\n\"With the support of the home unions we will be running programmes for existing youth players to keep them in the game,\" says Mr McEwen.\n\"It will be using the inspiration of the Lions brand to keep them playing at an age - late teens and early twenties - where there is a high drop-off rate.\"\nThe Lions' financial machine that generates those funds for developing the game is largely sponsor-driven.\nIn total there are 11 major commercial backers - from shirt sponsors Standard Life to brewery Doom Bar, the official beer of the Lions. Some three-quarters of the Lions income is from sponsorship, a much bigger proportion than that enjoyed by England's RFU or any of the other home unions.\n\"We hold sponsors and partners very dear,\" says Mr McEwen. \"We look to find brands that reflect our values and everything we stand for.\n\"We try to ensure we deliver against what they need, but also to make sure they don't compromise our values, or ability to perform on the field.

{"document": "\"The world must know that we do not intend to cheat,\" Hassan Rouhani said in a televised address to the nation.\nBut Mr Rouhani warned that Iran would have other options if world powers \"one day decide to follow a different path\".\nThe framework deal signed on Thursday will see Iran curb nuclear activities in return for relief from sanctions.\nEarlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that it posed a grave danger to the region, in particular his own country.\nHe said any compressive accord, due before 30 June, had to include a \"clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist\".\nBut the White House said the US would not sign an agreement over Iran's nuclear programme that would threaten Israel.\nWhite House spokesman Eric Shultz also announced that President Barack Obama would on Friday discuss the framework agreement with Congressional leaders, some of whom have been very sceptical of a deal.\nPresident Rouhani reiterated that Iran's nuclear programme was peaceful.\nThe country was \"not two-faced\", he said, and would honour any final deal provided the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany - did the same.\n\"If the other side acts on its promises, Iran will abide by its promises. If, however, they one day decide to follow a different path, our nation too will be always free to make [another] choice.\"\nMr Rouhani also stressed that the world now accepted Iran had the right to enrich uranium on its own soil, and that enrichment was not a threat to anyone.\nThere's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little.\nJohn Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb.\nAs hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place.\nJonathan Marcus: This is a deal that buys time\nWhat do Iranians think about nuclear deal?\nIranians celebrate nuclear deal in Tehran and online\nMixed media reaction to nuclear deal\nCan US Congress kill the deal?\n\"Enrichment and all our nuclear technology is merely for the progress of Iran. This enrichment and technology is not against any regional country or the world,\" he added.\nSince 2006, the UN Security Council has adopted six resolutions demanding Iran stop the activity because, while enriched uranium is used as fuel for nuclear reactors and for medical and agricultural purposes, it can also be used to make nuclear bombs.\n\"Today is a day that will remain in the historic memory of the Iranian nation,\" Mr Rouhani said.\n\"Some think that we must either fight the world or surrender to world powers. We say it is neither of those, there is a third way. We can have co-operation with the world.\"\nAfter the deal was announced on Thursday night, many Iranians took to the streets of Tehran to celebrate and posted messages of support on social media.\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, has not yet reacted to Thursday's announcement. But hardliners close to him have criticised it.\n\"To sum up the deal framework in one sentence - we handed over a saddled horse and received a broken bridle in return,\" Hossein Shariatmadari, one of Ayatollah Khamenei's advisers and editor of the influential hardline newspaper Kayhan, told the Fars news agency.\nPresident Obama said the framework agreement would make the world a safer place, as it would \"cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon\".\nUnder the agreement, Iran will cut by more than two-thirds to 5,060 the number of centrifuges it currently operates to enrich uranium. The Fordo underground nuclear facility will remain open for research but will not be used for enrichment.\nIran will also cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10 tonnes to 300kg for 15 years, and the design of the heavy-water reactor under construction at Arak will be modified so it produces no weapons-grade plutonium.\nIn return, UN sanctions and separate measures imposed unilaterally by the US and EU will be gradually suspended as the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirms Iranian compliance.\nIran's key nuclear sites", "summary": "Iran's president has vowed it will abide by the terms of the preliminary nuclear agreement it signed with six world powers, so long as they do too.", "id": "32176566", "text": "\"The world must know that we do not intend to cheat,\" Hassan Rouhani said in a televised address to the nation.\nBut Mr Rouhani warned that Iran would have other options if world powers \"one day decide to follow a different path\".\nThe framework deal signed on Thursday will see Iran curb nuclear activities in return for relief from sanctions.\nEarlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that it posed a grave danger to the region, in particular his own country.\nHe said any compressive accord, due before 30 June, had to include a \"clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist\".\nBut the White House said the US would not sign an agreement over Iran's nuclear programme that would threaten Israel.\nWhite House spokesman Eric Shultz also announced that President Barack Obama would on Friday discuss the framework agreement with Congressional leaders, some of whom have been very sceptical of a deal.\nPresident Rouhani reiterated that Iran's nuclear programme was peaceful.\nThe country was \"not two-faced\", he said, and would honour any final deal provided the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany - did the same.\n\"If the other side acts on its promises, Iran will abide by its promises. If, however, they one day decide to follow a different path, our nation too will be always free to make [another] choice.\"\nMr Rouhani also stressed that the world now accepted Iran had the right to enrich uranium on its own soil, and that enrichment was not a threat to anyone.\nThere's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little.\nJohn Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb.\nAs hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place.\nJonathan Marcus: This is a deal that buys time\nWhat do Iranians think about nuclear deal?\nIranians celebrate nuclear deal in Tehran and online\nMixed media reaction to nuclear deal\nCan US Congress kill the deal?\n\"Enrichment and all our nuclear technology is merely for the progress of Iran. This enrichment and technology is not against any regional country or the world,\" he added.\nSince 2006, the UN Security Council has adopted six resolutions demanding Iran stop the activity because, while enriched uranium is used as fuel for nuclear reactors and for medical and agricultural purposes, it can also be used to make nuclear bombs.\n\"Today is a day that will remain in the historic memory of the Iranian nation,\" Mr Rouhani said.\n\"Some think that we must either fight the world or surrender to world powers. We say it is neither of those, there is a third way. We can have co-operation with the world.\"\nAfter the deal was announced on Thursday night, many Iranians took to the streets of Tehran to celebrate and posted messages of support on social media.\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, has not yet reacted to Thursday's announcement.

pressure on services.\nAMs said efforts made around winter tended to focus more on \"fire-fighting\" than changing the whole system.\n\"It is clear from the evidence we heard that the many pressures

Lloyd called for more to be done to ensure staff \"do not get ill in the first place\".\nPublic Health Wales said the jab uptake was the highest it has been in Wales.\nNicola Meredith, lead nurse for flu in the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales, said: \"The annual flu vaccine is recommended for all frontline health and social care workers in Wales to help protect them from catching and spreading the infection.\"\nShe said the uptake of the vaccine in NHS workers has been increasing each year and that for 2015-16 it was the highest yet.\n\"As well as frontline staff, it's also really important for people more at risk of developing complications of flu to get the vaccine, such as pregnant women, those aged 65 and over, and people with long term health conditions,\" she added.\n\"In 2015-16, more people in these groups than ever had the flu vaccine.\"\nTina Donnelly, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, said: \"Up to one in four frontline health care staff may become infected by flu every winter, even in a mild season.\n\"We are acutely aware that this is individual choice and cannot be mandated.\n\"However, it is nurses' responsibility to keep themselves as fit as possible so that they do not put patients at risk and we would urge our members to have the flu jab.\"\nThe committee's report also suggested the NHS would be better able to deal with winter pressures if it could deal with difficulties throughout the year.\nIt argued a more resilient NHS all-year round was the best way to cope with increased pressure on services.\nAMs said efforts made around winter tended to focus more on \"fire-fighting\" than changing the whole system.\n\"It is clear from the evidence we heard that the many pressures facing the NHS in Wales are not restricted to a particular period or season but are, in fact, all year round,\" said Dr Lloyd.\n\"Nevertheless, it is also clear that there are seasonal spikes in demand, especially during the winter months, which put an already stretched system under further strain.\"\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was \"encouraged\" by the recommendations of the health committee's report.\n\"The bottom line is that more care needs to be delivered in the community by GPs, pharmacists and urgent care centres,\" said its Wales officer, Dr Mair Parry.\nAn extra Â£50m is being made available for NHS Wales by the Welsh Government to deal with winter pressures on hospitals.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We welcome the committee's report and will consider their findings in due course but firmly believe the extensive local and national preparation that has been put in place will deliver robust, resilient services so that people have access to the care they require, when they need it.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "Less than half of frontline NHS staff had the flu jab last year, according to a report."}

There's also the rise of artificial intelligence, which has led to massive job cuts at Indian IT firms.\nIn a statement, Infosys said it was \"profoundly distressed\" by the personal attacks on its management team in recent months.\nThe company denounced its critics and said the allegations had \"harmed employee morale and contributed to the loss of the company's valued CEO\".\nIt praised Mr Sikka's efforts in providing a new direction for the company, increasing revenues and reducing employee attrition.\nMr Sikka will receive an annual salary of $1 in his new role as executive vice chairman.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "The chief executive of Infosys, Vishal Sikka, has resigned from his post with an unconventional and lengthy letter blaming \"personal attacks\"."}

{"document": "Cook gave up the captaincy in February after a record 59 Tests in charge, but opted to continue playing.\nHe told BBC Sport that matches such as England's third Test victory over South Africa on Monday have offered him a new perspective on playing.\n\"There have been moments where you question yourself and your motivation,\" the 32-year-old said.\n\"But then you get weeks like last week, and days like Monday, where you're winning and you're so involved in it.\"\nBy last week, Cook means the third Test at The Oval - a Test which saw a hat-trick, a dream debut and a mix of entertaining and gritty batting as England registered an emphatic 239-run win.\nHe was at the other end when his Essex team-mate Tom Westley, who has known Cook since he was 14, made his international debut in London, and it is those moments that have convinced Cook to carry on.\n\"Watching him go through the trials and tribulations of becoming a professional cricketer, to realise his dream, and then we come through at the other end as really good mates and seeing his whole family come down to The Oval - it makes you realise that is why you want to carry on playing,\" Cook said.\n\"To have special moments like that makes you see that that 'yes, I do want to carry on' and I am very motivated to do it. If it does end tomorrow, I'll be sad but I'll be proud of what I've achieved.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAs captain, Cook saw series victories in South Africa and India, as well as two Ashes wins on home soil, with Cook himself becoming the first Englishman to reach 10,000 Test runs in this period.\nHowever, there were difficult times. A 5-0 series whitewash in Australia, the ongoing Kevin Pietersen saga and a perception of Cook himself as being a dour captain meant he was often under pressure.\n\"It's definitely different without the captaincy and I do feel less under pressure in the field,\" he said.\n\"On Monday, when South Africa were chasing - if I was captain on that Sunday night, I would definitely have had a broken sleep. I would have been worried and a lot more nervous.\n\"As it was, I turned up on Monday thinking 'we can win this quite easy'.

{"document": "Neighbours of Saad al-Hilli in Claygate were evacuated as items in a garden shed were examined but police later said they were not \"hazardous\".\nMeanwhile, French police have confirmed the death of Mr al-Hilli's 74-year old mother-in-law, but have not named her.\nThe al-Hillis' eldest daughter Zainab has been brought out of a coma.\nThe seven-year-old was shot and injured during the attack last week.  Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, has returned to the UK.\nZeena lay undiscovered for eight hours after her parents, her grandmother, and a local cyclist died in Wednesday's attack in Chevaline.\nFrench and British investigators, including Surrey Police firearms officers, started examining the Claygate home of Mr al-Hilli, 50, on Saturday as part of an attempt to establish a motive for the murders which took place during the family's camping holiday.\nOfficers from the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit arrived at the family home after concerns were raised by Surrey Police.\nThey spent about two hours at the property before leaving shortly after midday.\nAn extended cordon, put up around the property while the explosives experts were there, has since been relaxed and residents have returned to their homes.\nSurrey Police said: \"The items were found... when the search of the property was extended from the main building to outbuildings in the garden. A bomb disposal unit was called to the scene to carry out an assessment as a precautionary measure.\"\nA cordon around the house and gardens will remain in place as the search of the property continues.\nSurrey Police said earlier that the investigation is French-led, with British officers facilitating requests rather than following their own leads.\nOn Sunday, French prosecutor Eric Maillaud has said seven-year-old Zainab is still under sedation and will not be able to be questioned for several more days.\nMr Maillaud said her sister Zeena has returned to the UK.\nThe French prosecutor said: \"She returned to the UK by air. On arrival she was put under the care of the authorities and the social services.\"\nBy Keith DoyleBBC News in Claygate\nNeighbours on this pleasant street flanked by large houses have spent much of the morning wondering what the threat was and when they could return to their homes.\nEarlier, the police suddenly pushed the media back from our position outside the gates of the al-Hilli home.\nThey said they had discovered items of concern in the house.\nA sudden surge of news teams and onlookers appeared and concerned police kept trying to push people further back.\nWhen the bomb disposal team arrived, the reason for the frantic activity became clearer.\nAfter a couple of hours of fevered speculation it became apparent there was no air of urgency among members of the Royal Logistics Corps.\nThey were not wearing protective clothing and appeared relaxed. Soon after, they left.\nA worrying morning for locals, already shocked by the brutal murder of their neighbours, was over.\nIn an earlier briefing, Mr Maillaud told reporters Zeena had been interviewed, but he did not see a need to speak to her again as she \"did not see anything\".\nA spokesman for Surrey County Council confirmed it was working with the French and British authorities.\nIn a statement, Darryl Taylor, the girls' head teacher at Claygate Primary School, said: \"The thoughts of everyone connected with the school are with relatives and friends at this difficult time.

Soon after, they left.\nA worrying morning for locals, already shocked by the brutal murder of their neighbours, was over.\nIn an earlier briefing, Mr Maillaud told reporters Zeena had been interviewed, but he did not see a need to speak to her again as she \"did not see anything\".\nA spokesman for Surrey County Council confirmed it was working with the French and British authorities.\nIn a statement, Darryl Taylor, the girls' head teacher at Claygate Primary School, said: \"The thoughts of everyone connected with the school are with relatives and friends at this difficult time.

I have hit the ball cleaner and started to see the right shots at the right moments.\n\"Yeah, I've come a long way the last 10 days or so.\"\nAnalysis from BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Roland Garros\nMurray served very well in an extremely efficient win on a breezy Paris afternoon - losing only seven points on second serve in the entire match.\nKhachanov did not seem at all over-awed by the occasion, and continued to hit with freedom, but Murray's guile neutralised his power sufficiently.\nThe world number one is in the best shape he could have hoped for ahead of the quarter-finals.\nTwo consecutive straight-sets wins have conserved energy and he has as good a chance of anyone of making the final from his half of the draw.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "Britain's Andy Murray produced a clinical performance to see off Russian Karen Khachanov and reach a seventh French Open quarter-final."}

He played 141 minutes over three games for Arsenal last season but such is Hodgson's admiration for Wilshere he simply could not travel to France without him.\nWilshere is a fierce competitor and may turn things around but his selection currently looks an indulgent mistake of the sort Eriksson made when he took David Beckham to the World Cup in Japan in 2002 and Rooney to Germany four years later.\nBeckham and Rooney were never at their best and Wilshere's plight is even more acute.\nWilshere will be back. Hodgson will hope it is in France but the evidence of Saint-Etienne suggests it will be later.\nEngland had been aiming for a last-16 game in Paris on Saturday - now they will be off to the south of France to Nice to face whoever finishes second in Group F, Iceland, Portugal, Austria or Hungary.\nIf they negotiate that, it looks increasingly like they will have to step into an emotional Paris environment to face the hosts in the quarter-finals.\nNot easy - but this is a problem of Hodgson's own making and one he may now feel he could have done better to avoid.\nCreate leagues and play against your friends in BBC Sport's new Euro 2016 Predictor game", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "England's failure to beat mediocre Slovakia in Saint-Etienne - as well as Group B's weak link Russia - leaves them and manager Roy Hodgson badly exposed at Euro 2016."}

{"document": "The three \"traitors\" were to be shown mercy - their bodies would not be quartered after hanging and beheading.\nBut as the crowds watched them die outside Derby prison, the storm of protest about their cause, crimes and fate had already begun.\nThe year of 1817 was a particularly bad time to be poor.\nThe economy was in a slump, laws kept the landowners rich and the previous \"year without summer\" had left workers' families hungry and diseased.\nPolitical reform and the rights of common people were fiercely debated but Lord Liverpool's Tory government - under the dissolute Prince Regent, George - met calls for change with prison, execution or transportation to the colonies.\nDr Cath Feely, from the University of Derby, said: \"These are people who had no control over their lives, either nationally or locally, politically or financially.\n\"They faced a double whammy that the old aristocracy owned their homes, while the new industrial class owned their livelihoods.\n\"And with no welfare safety net, a bad harvest was a matter of life and death.\"\nA network of informers left over from the Napoleonic wars now worked against political groups - some peaceful, some not - creating an atmosphere of insecurity and paranoia.\nBritain simmered with discontent in the early years of the 19th Century and demands for greater rights led to disputes, destruction and death.\nHampden Clubs, named after a leader in the English Civil War, began in 1812 and attracted radical debate but were seen by the authorities as a cover for revolution.\nDisorder and protests like the Spa Fields riots of 1816 and the Blanketeers of 1817 led to the suspension of basic civil rights, such as Habeas Corpus.\nThe most high profile group was the Luddites, named after the mythical Ned Ludd, who from 1811 to 1816 smashed the cloth-making machinery they felt was being used to drive down craftsmen's wages.\nThe establishment was shaken - at one point more troops were deployed to deal with Luddites than Wellington had to fight Napoleon.\nRepression turned to murder in 1819 when cavalry rode down a peaceful reform meeting in Manchester, killing 18, in what became known as the Peterloo Massacre.\nA plan to murder the prime minister and his cabinet in 1820, the Cato Street Conspiracy, led to the execution of five men.\nOne of these informers, William J Richards - known as Oliver - became the catalyst for events.\nPentrich historian Sylvia Mason said: \"Oliver was pulled out of debtors' prison on the proviso he would spy for the government.\n\"He was paid on results, so he created those results.\"\nIn early 1817 in Derbyshire he met political firebrands Thomas Bacon and Jeremiah Brandreth. Despite objections, Oliver persuaded them \"half the country\" was ready to rise.\nBrandreth held meetings in a Pentrich inn, calling for a march on Nottingham, insisting they would be paid and fed.\nAll the while Oliver kept the authorities informed.\nMs Mason said: \"The government as good as organised it - they named the day in documents and showed they were planning it from 1815.\n\"They were afraid a real uprising was coming so they allowed the Pentrich men to march so they could be arrested as used as scapegoats.\"\nOn 9 June, up to 400 rebels armed with farming tools and old hunting guns set off for nearby Ripley.\nThe weather was foul and Brandreth led them in songs to raise their spirits; \"The time is come you plainly see, the government opposed must be.\"\nDr Feely said: \"Their demands were vague; a cancellation of the national debt, some calls for a provisional government.\n\"But most were focused on fairer wages and protection for their livelihoods.\"\nDemands for food and drink led to fights and at one house a servant was shot and killed, apparently by accident.\nThey slogged on through the day and overnight but the death, the weather, the lukewarm public reaction and the failure to seize new weapons in Ripley saw numbers dwindle.\nAs the remaining men approached Eastwood on the outskirts of Nottingham on the morning of 10 June, two magistrates, accompanied by soldiers, blocked the way.\nWithout a shot being fired, the marchers fled. Despite this, some newspapers reported hundreds of well armed men on the rampage.\nRetribution was well planned. Dozens were imprisoned, the ringleaders found over the coming months.\nThe trial that followed was, according to many, deeply flawed.

Despite objections, Oliver persuaded them \"half the country\" was ready to rise.\nBrandreth held meetings in a Pentrich inn, calling for a march on Nottingham, insisting they would be paid and fed.\nAll the while Oliver kept the authorities informed.\nMs Mason said: \"The government as good as organised it - they named the day in documents and showed they were planning it from 1815.\n\"They were afraid a real uprising was coming so they allowed the Pentrich men to march so they could be arrested as used as scapegoats.\"\nOn 9 June, up to 400 rebels armed with farming tools and old hunting guns set off for nearby Ripley.\nThe weather was foul and Brandreth led them in songs to raise their spirits; \"The time is come you plainly see, the government opposed must be.\"\nDr Feely said: \"Their demands were vague; a cancellation of the national debt, some calls for a provisional government.\n\"But most were focused on fairer wages and protection for their livelihoods.\"\nDemands for food and drink led to fights and at one house a servant was shot and killed, apparently by accident.\nThey slogged on through the day and overnight but the death, the weather, the lukewarm public reaction and the failure to seize new weapons in Ripley saw numbers dwindle.\nAs the remaining men approached Eastwood on the outskirts of Nottingham on the morning of 10 June, two magistrates, accompanied by soldiers, blocked the way.\nWithout a shot being fired, the marchers fled. Despite this, some newspapers reported hundreds of well armed men on the rampage.\nRetribution was well planned. Dozens were imprisoned, the ringleaders found over the coming months.\nThe trial that followed was, according to many, deeply flawed. The main jury was made up of landowners and factory bosses, who would feel most threatened by the marchers.\nOliver, already unmasked and widely criticised, was kept hidden away.\nBacon's guilty plea - in return for no death penalty - meant no trial, which further hid the agent's role.\nBrandreth, with lieutenants William Turner and Isaac Ludlam, were sentenced to their grisly fates.

With the loss of six seats, they will be forming a minority administration, having enjoyed a majority for the last five years.\nThis note of disgruntlement comes down to two factors....\nSince the 2014 independence referendum the SNP has been an absolute juggernaut. Its membership has swelled to more than 116,000, the party's conferences and even manifesto launches are more like rock concerts than sober discussions of public policy.\nIt smashed its rivals in the 2015 general election, coming near to sweeping the entire country, and every poll predicted a second outright majority at Holyrood on Thursday. As we now know, this was not to be.\nIn truth, the position the SNP occupied prior to polls opening was already unprecedented. Holyrood isn't meant to have a single party commanding an outright majority - the way the electoral system is set up works very effectively against this.\nSo if the 2016 results might seem like a relative disappointment for the SNP, it is because whether by force or fluke, they broke the system in 2011.\nHolyrood's Additional Member System strives for a model of proportional representation. While the Westminster model of first past the post is geared towards strong governments toting stonking majorities, Holyrood's system seeks balance and fairness between parties.\nAnd in this regard, it appears to have worked to perfection; on Thursday, the SNP won just under half of the votes cast, and will head back to Holyrood with just under half of the MSPs.\nThere's an obvious contrast with the 2015 general election; there, the SNP won 50% of the vote in Scotland, and were rewarded with 95% of the seats on offer. Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems netted a solitary MP each, despite their wildly differing performances on the night of 24%, 15% and 7.5% respectively.\nThese are the kind of quirks the complex calculation at the heart of Holyrood's system - the D'Hondt method, named for the Belgian mathematician who created it - is designed to iron out.\nIn simple terms (avoiding entirely any talk of \"quant = V / s+1\"), the more seats a party wins in the 'first past the post' constituency races, the less they are likely to collect some in the regional list.\nAn example is Glasgow - the SNP swept all eight constituency seats, thumping Labour in what was once their back yard. This meant they were already handsomely represented in the area, leaving Labour, the Tories and the Greens to share out the list seats according to their share of that vote.\nIt would have been almost impossible for the SNP to add to their tally in Glasgow - hence some supporters of other pro-independence parties, such as Rise, Solidarity, and the Greens, campaigning hard for list-vote support from SNP constituency-voters.\nHowever, the SNP didn't want to run any risks with their campaign. Because if somehow Labour had held one or two of the Glasgow constituencies, they would want to have a strong chance at picking those seats up again on the list. Hence \"both votes SNP\" came to be plastered across every bit of their campaign material.\nNow, in the Holyrood election just past, it was widely expected that the SNP would win enough seats from the 73 constituencies up for grabs to form a majority outright, without having to rely on the allocation of MSPs from the regional lists.\nThey did not.

But they also lost some - and in key areas.\nWillie Rennie and his Lib Dems frustrated them, swatting away challengers in Orkney and Shetland with ease despite the controversy of the Alistair Carmichael affair, before actually seizing SNP seats in North East Fife and Edinburgh Western.\nThe Tories too mounted successful raids, with Ruth Davidson pinching Edinburgh Central and Alexander Burnett toppling Dennis Robertson in Aberdeenshire West - both surprising results.\nMs Davidson's party also took seats from Labour which the SNP considered themselves strongly in the hunt for, in Dumfriesshire and Eastwood.\nThe placing of these seats, nestled among great blocs painted SNP yellow, meant the nationalists had relatively little hope of gaining them back on the list vote.\nThe only region of the country where the SNP didn't win the majority of constituency seats was South Scotland - and there they picked up three list seats.

{"document": "But no penalty was imposed by the court near Amsterdam on Wilders, whose party is leading in polls ahead of parliamentary elections in March.\nWilders was also acquitted of inciting hate over telling supporters in March 2014 he would ensure there were fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands.\nHe called the guilty verdict \"madness\" in a tweet posted a short time later.\nHe said he would appeal.\nThe three-week trial was triggered when police received 6,400 complaints about remarks Wilders made during a municipal election campaign in The Hague.\nAt a rally, he asked supporters whether they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands\".\nWhen the crowd shouted back \"Fewer! Fewer!\" a smiling Wilders responded: \"We're going to take care of that.\"\nAt the trial, prosecutors took testimony from Dutch-Moroccans who said his comments made them feel like \"third-rate citizens\".\nThis guilty verdict will do little to damage Geert Wilders' political aspirations.\nIn fact, the trial has provided the populist leader with the two vital elements upon which his party thrives - a platform to promote his political message and masses of media attention. In court he repeated warnings about the dangers of Islam and immigration.\nMany supporters see this trial as reaffirming their belief that Wilders is a courageous leader prepared to stand up for them and address the issues a politically correct elite is afraid to talk about.

{"document": "To Kill a Mockingbird has been in print for more than five decades and few works have been subject to as much critical analysis and interpretation.\nIt has become a set book in school literature studies and regularly appears on lists of books that are essential reading.\nYet its author refused all requests for interviews and public appearances and there was surprise when, in 2015, it was announced she had previously written a sequel.\nNelle Harper Lee was born in Monroeville, Alabama, the youngest child of Frances Finch Lee and Amasa Coleman Lee. Her father was a  former newspaper editor and proprietor, who practised as a lawyer in the town.\nShe studied law at the University of Alabama from 1945 to 1949, and spent a year at Oxford University as an exchange student - originally intending to work as a lawyer in her father's firm.\nHowever, six months before finishing her studies, Lee went to New York to pursue a literary career.\nIn 1957 she submitted a manuscript of her first novel to JB Lippincott Company. They told her it was \"a series of short stories\" and encouraged her to rewrite it.\nLee spent the next two-and-a-half years reworking the book, which was published in 1960.  It was an immediate success, becoming an international bestseller, and receiving critical acclaim. Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1961.\nSemi-autobiographical, the novel is set in a small Alabama town, and several of the characters are drawn from life. The lawyer Atticus Finch was modelled on Lee's own father, and the character of Dill was drawn from Truman Capote, Lee's childhood friend.\nNarrated by Atticus Finch's daughter, it is the story of his defence of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl from a poor family.\nThough he is clearly innocent, Robinson is convicted of the crime by a white jury, and shot dead while trying to escape. The story emphasises that children are born with an instinct for justice and absorb prejudices in the socialisation process.\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in 1962, and won four Oscars, including best actor for Gregory Peck - who played Atticus Finch.\nLee was so impressed by Peck's performance that she presented him with her father's watch. Both her hometown Monroeville and Mobile, another Alabama city, had petitions to host its premiere.

Her father was a  former newspaper editor and proprietor, who practised as a lawyer in the town.\nShe studied law at the University of Alabama from 1945 to 1949, and spent a year at Oxford University as an exchange student - originally intending to work as a lawyer in her father's firm.\nHowever, six months before finishing her studies, Lee went to New York to pursue a literary career.\nIn 1957 she submitted a manuscript of her first novel to JB Lippincott Company. They told her it was \"a series of short stories\" and encouraged her to rewrite it.\nLee spent the next two-and-a-half years reworking the book, which was published in 1960.  It was an immediate success, becoming an international bestseller, and receiving critical acclaim. Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1961.\nSemi-autobiographical, the novel is set in a small Alabama town, and several of the characters are drawn from life. The lawyer Atticus Finch was modelled on Lee's own father, and the character of Dill was drawn from Truman Capote, Lee's childhood friend.\nNarrated by Atticus Finch's daughter, it is the story of his defence of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl from a poor family.\nThough he is clearly innocent, Robinson is convicted of the crime by a white jury, and shot dead while trying to escape. The story emphasises that children are born with an instinct for justice and absorb prejudices in the socialisation process.\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in 1962, and won four Oscars, including best actor for Gregory Peck - who played Atticus Finch.\nLee was so impressed by Peck's performance that she presented him with her father's watch. Both her hometown Monroeville and Mobile, another Alabama city, had petitions to host its premiere.

{"document": "So wrote HG Wells in a letter to the Times 80 years ago, in 1934.\nThe author, famed for being an early pioneer of science-fiction writing, also had a strong interest in helping people with diabetes - because he was one of them.\nA year before, another letter from him had appeared in the newspaper appealing for funds to support the diabetes clinic at King's College Hospital in London.\nThe letter to The Times\nIts success led the renowned thinker to believe people were willing to support a more adventurous enterprise.\n\"Something psychologically and socially valuable had been discovered: the latent solidarity of people subject to a distinctive disorder,\" he wrote in 1934.\nMore prosperous people with diabetes were to be approached, to pay Â£5 to become members of the Diabetes Association, which would then work for everyone with the condition.\nHG Wells wrote more than 100 books, including the science-fiction tales The Island of Dr Moreau, The Invisible Man and The Time Machine.\nBut it was his doctor Robert Daniel (RD) Lawrence who persuaded him to lead the campaign to raise funds for diabetes.\nDr Lawrence's clinic at King's College Hospital in London had become cramped and outdated, so in 1933 he asked some of his more affluent patients for contributions.\nWells initially gave just 2s 6d to fund the association, pleading poverty.\nBut when Lawrence complained, Wells wrote his first letter to the Times - appealing for others to contribute funds - and got the funding needed for new and improved facilities.\nDr Lawrence had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1920, when there was no effective treatment and the condition was fatal.\nHe moved to Italy, expecting to live out his last few years there. But in early 1923, he received a telegram from a colleague at King's Hospital London that said: \"Insulin, it works. Come quick.\"\nHis biographer and daughter-in-law Jane Lawrence tells how, by that point, he was \"dwindling away\" but he made it back across Europe and received his first dose of insulin in May of that year.\"\nRD Lawrence went on to become a leading figure in forging understanding of diabetes as a condition and  fighting for those with it be able to live normal lives.\nHis writings helped define how diabetes was viewed for decades. His book The Diabetic Life was first published in 1925, ran to 14 editions and was published in many languages. A practical guide to living with diabetes, The Diabetic ABC, was published in 1929.\nForming the Diabetic Association was part of that. Dr Lawrence was elected chairman - a position he held until 1961 - while HG Wells became president.\nJane Lawrence says: \"This was the first patient-centred association in the world. It was so unusual in those days where the doctor was 'god'.\"\nNot long before this, type 1 diabetes had been a death sentence. People with the condition needed insulin - and it was only used in humans in 1922.\nDiabetes UK\nEven in the 1930s, people would only have had access to insulin if they could afford it and life would not have been pleasant, even for them.\nThey would have had to use large, thick needles to administer insulin, which was from animals and not fully purified and so there was a high risk of allergic reactions.

But in early 1923, he received a telegram from a colleague at King's Hospital London that said: \"Insulin, it works. Come quick.\"\nHis biographer and daughter-in-law Jane Lawrence tells how, by that point, he was \"dwindling away\" but he made it back across Europe and received his first dose of insulin in May of that year.\"\nRD Lawrence went on to become a leading figure in forging understanding of diabetes as a condition and  fighting for those with it be able to live normal lives.\nHis writings helped define how diabetes was viewed for decades. His book The Diabetic Life was first published in 1925, ran to 14 editions and was published in many languages. A practical guide to living with diabetes, The Diabetic ABC, was published in 1929.\nForming the Diabetic Association was part of that. Dr Lawrence was elected chairman - a position he held until 1961 - while HG Wells became president.\nJane Lawrence says: \"This was the first patient-centred association in the world. It was so unusual in those days where the doctor was 'god'.\"\nNot long before this, type 1 diabetes had been a death sentence. People with the condition needed insulin - and it was only used in humans in 1922.\nDiabetes UK\nEven in the 1930s, people would only have had access to insulin if they could afford it and life would not have been pleasant, even for them.\nThey would have had to use large, thick needles to administer insulin, which was from animals and not fully purified and so there was a high risk of allergic reactions. Today, most insulin is made in laboratories.\nThe needles they used would have needed to be washed and sterilised every day - as well as sharpened regularly.\nThey were given a fixed amount of insulin - so would have to eat the right amount of food to counteract this, whether or not this left them feeling too full or still hungry.\nAnd their diet had to be around 70% fat.\nOne of the association's first campaigns was for free access to insulin, well before the formation of the NHS.\nThe organisation became the British Diabetic Association in 1954 and Diabetes UK in 2000.\nIt is now a charity with an annual income of Â£28m, with 300,000 supporters across the UK.\nThere are 3.2m people diagnosed with the condition, and an estimated 630,000 who have diabetes, but don't know it.

{"document": "This is the conclusion of three teams that have modelled its behaviour.\nEven if the region were to experience much colder conditions, the retreat would continue, the teams tell the journal Nature Climate Change.\nThis means PIG is set to become an even more significant contributor to global sea level rise - on the order of perhaps 3.5-10mm in the next 20 years.\n\"You can think of PIG like a ball. It's been kicked and it's just going to keep on rolling for the foreseeable future,\" said Dr Hilmar Gudmundsson from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).\nPIG is a colossal feature. Covering more than 160,000 sq km (two-thirds the size of the UK), it drains something like 20% of all the ice flowing off the west of the White Continent.\nSatellite and airborne measurements have recorded a marked thinning and a surge in velocity in recent decades.\nIts grounding line - the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up and floats - has reversed tens of km over the same period.\nMuch of this behaviour is driven not by higher air temperatures in the cold south but by warm ocean bottom-waters getting under and eroding the floating ice shelf at the head of the glacier.\nKey to PIG's observed behaviour is that a large section of it sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping back towards the continent.\nThis can produce what scientists refer to as a \"marine ice sheet instability\" - an inherently unstable architecture, which, once knocked, can go into an irreversible decline.\nDr Gudmundsson's group, together with colleagues in the UK, France, Finland and China, have used numerical models to describe PIG's current and future behaviour, and they argue that it has now entered just such a mode.\n\"Even if you were to reduce melt rates, you would not stop the retreat,\" Dr Gudmundsson told BBC News.\n\"We did a number of model runs where we allowed PIG to retreat some distance back, and then we lowered the melt rates in our models.

It's been kicked and it's just going to keep on rolling for the foreseeable future,\" said Dr Hilmar Gudmundsson from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).\nPIG is a colossal feature. Covering more than 160,000 sq km (two-thirds the size of the UK), it drains something like 20% of all the ice flowing off the west of the White Continent.\nSatellite and airborne measurements have recorded a marked thinning and a surge in velocity in recent decades.\nIts grounding line - the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up and floats - has reversed tens of km over the same period.\nMuch of this behaviour is driven not by higher air temperatures in the cold south but by warm ocean bottom-waters getting under and eroding the floating ice shelf at the head of the glacier.\nKey to PIG's observed behaviour is that a large section of it sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping back towards the continent.\nThis can produce what scientists refer to as a \"marine ice sheet instability\" - an inherently unstable architecture, which, once knocked, can go into an irreversible decline.\nDr Gudmundsson's group, together with colleagues in the UK, France, Finland and China, have used numerical models to describe PIG's current and future behaviour, and they argue that it has now entered just such a mode.\n\"Even if you were to reduce melt rates, you would not stop the retreat,\" Dr Gudmundsson told BBC News.\n\"We did a number of model runs where we allowed PIG to retreat some distance back, and then we lowered the melt rates in our models.

Police say they've found a body in Wentwood Reservoir. Do you think it might be Sandie Bowen?\"\nIt took a moment for the information - a few brief paragraphs from our internal news feed - to register properly, and for me to realise the possible implications.\nWithin 24 hours, police confirmed that the human remains recovered from the reservoir were female.\nIt would be several more weeks before we knew for sure, before relatives would finally get the call they'd been waiting so long for.\nNearly 20 years on, the Wye Valley countryside had at last surrendered one of its most enduring mysteries: the whereabouts of the body of murdered Sandie Bowen.\nI'd been crime correspondent for The Western Mail, Wales' daily newspaper, for only a couple of months when, in early August 1997, Gwent Police announced that they were growing increasingly concerned for a woman who had gone missing from her home in Monmouthshire.\nThe search for Sandie Bowen turned out to be one of the most extensive - and expensive - investigations ever carried out by Gwent Police.\nJournalists followed the story closely, jostling for the best \"lines\" to update every twist and turn as the weeks and then months ticked by.\nWhat began as a missing person inquiry, following 54-year-old Sandie's sudden and unexpected disappearance, had quickly turned into a murder investigation.\nThe last reported sighting of Sandie came from her husband, Michael Bowen.\nHe told police he had dropped her off outside Newport train station on the afternoon of 6 August 1997. She was heading to Folkestone in Kent to visit her daughter, Anita Spencer, he told officers.\nIt was 33-year-old Anita who reported her mother missing shortly after receiving a telephone call from her stepfather that evening asking if Sandie had arrived safely in Folkestone.\nAnita had last spoken to her mother the previous day and there was no talk of her coming to visit.\nAfter checking train ticket sales and railway station CCTV, detectives quickly formed the view that the answer to Sandie's disappearance lay much closer to home.\nThe countryside where police have always believed her body had been hidden is, in many ways, an integral part of this story.\nWentwood Forest stands on the hillside a few miles from the bucolic village of Llandogo, between Tintern and  Monmouth, where Sandie lived.\nMore than 1,000 hectares of the oldest ancient woodland in Wales, the forest straddles the border between Monmouthshire and Newport counties in the south east corner of Wales and reaches 309 metres at its highest point.\nThe Bowens' house, replete with climbing roses round the front door, looked out over fields running down towards the River Wye.\nI knew the area well, having lived as a child in the hamlet of Brockweir, just a mile or two over the river.\nThe Sloop Inn, Llandogo's only pub, was a popular venue for local bands when I was in my late teens.\nThe landlord of the Sloop, George Morgan, was friendly with the Bowens.\nHe went fishing for salmon with Michael Bowen; Sandie worked for him at the Sloop and also his guest house, Valley House, as a catering assistant and cleaner.\nThis connection would become central to the case, after claims emerged that Sandie and George had been having an affair when she went missing.\nScores of police officers and volunteers from mountain rescue teams as far afield as north Wales, Dartmoor and the Peak District were drafted in.\nThe police helicopter and aircraft fitted with thermal imaging equipment swept across the forest at night, and at day break police divers resumed searches of the nearby Wentwood Reservoir.\nBut no body was found.\nIn mid-August Anita, Sandie's daughter, issued an emotional appeal.\nShe told journalists she would chat to her mother two or three times a week and said her disappearance was \"totally out of character\".\nHer stepfather Michael Bowen was invited to take part in the press conference but declined.\nBowen had been married twice before meeting Sandie, and had four children of his own.\nThe couple began a relationship in 1991 when he was working as a train driver on the Channel Tunnel and staying at Folkestone lodgings where Sandie worked as a cook.\nFor Sandie, who was divorced from her first husband, it was a second chance at love.\nAfter Bowen separated from his second wife, she decided to move to south Wales to be with him.\nAnita, an only child with young children of her own, clashed with her mother over what she felt was an impulsive decision - although she could see how happy she was.\nSandie married Michael Bowen in 1993 but within a couple of years cracks were appearing; both were said to be having affairs.\nBowen told police that, as far as he was concerned, they had been living separate lives for the past two years.\nHe believed Sandie was going to Kent \"to think about things\" after he told her he wanted a divorce.\nBut before the month was out, he'd been arrested, charged with her murder and remanded in custody.\nUp until this point, Anita hadn't suspected her stepfather.\n\"I didn't really know him, I'd only met him a couple of times,\" she says. \"He was very charming when I met him and he was charming with mum.\n\"He swept her off her feet, showered her with gifts and took her out to nice places.\"\nAnd so the hunt for Sandie's remains continued.\nAs autumn wore on, and then winter arrived, hopes were beginning to fade.\nSpring 1998 brought short-lived hope of a breakthrough, when renewed searches uncovered a woman's body in a shallow woodland grave.\nIt turned out to be a Newport youth worker, killed by her partner who then committed suicide.\nFollowing his trial 46-year-old Bowen was convicted of murdering Sandie and jailed for life at Newport Crown Court in May 1998.\nThe jury was told that although no body had been found, there was a \"compelling and overwhelming\" jigsaw of circumstantial evidence pointing to Bowen's guilt.\nThe trial heard evidence of his anger over her affair, despite his own infidelity and that a speck of Sandie's blood was found by forensic investigators in their bedroom.\nAnd a key element of the case - her false teeth, which her daughter insisted she would never have left home without, were found discarded in a waste bin at her home.\nOther personal belongings recovered from the house included her handbag, arthritis medication, spectacles, jewellery and the remains of her purse and credit cards, burnt in a fireplace.\nThe prosecution case asserted that Bowen, a forestry worker with intimate knowledge of the area, had murdered his wife in a fit of temper at their home, then driven off into the forest in the dead of night and concealed her body there so effectively it had never been found.\nGiving evidence, the woman Bowen was having an affair with spoke of hearing his distinctive Land Rover passing her house at 02:00 on the morning of 6 August.\nWithin days of Sandie's disappearance, she had moved into their home, Bowen reportedly telling her that Sandie was \"never coming back.\"\nAfter a five-week trial, including more than 76 witnesses, the jury took just six hours to unanimously convict him.\nSetting a minimum term of 18 years' imprisonment, judge Mr Justice Eady told Bowen he had \"embarked on a remarkably callous and cold exercise in disposing of her remains\".\nHe added: \"Sandie Bowen's daughter and family do not know, and may never know, where her body lies.\"\nI remember Anita, a mother of three boys, sitting behind me and my colleagues in the press bench during the closing stages of the case. She sobbed, shaking with emotion, as Bowen was led from the dock to begin his sentence.\n\"A guilty verdict does not end it,\" she told reporters on the court steps.\n\"Without a body it goes on for me and the children. I would just ask Mike, now he has been convicted, why not just say where she is?\n\"The past few months have been hell. I can't have a funeral without a body; I can't bury her.\"\nBowen appealed against his conviction, but this was turned down a year later in May 1999.\nEvidence emerged during the appeal hearing of Bowen's violence towards his first two wives, as well as an entry from Sandie's diary, indicating he'd once tried to strangle her.\nAgain, Anita issued a plea for him to reveal her mother's whereabouts. Again, nothing.\nFishing boat\nI hadn't spoken to Anita since Bowen's failed appeal, but the story stayed with me and would still crop up as a topic of conversation with other journalists.\nIn 2002, Bowen finally admitted responsibility for Sandie's death, telling police she had fallen into the water during an argument on his fishing boat.\nBut still he didn't reveal where the body could be found, and Anita's torment went on.\nBowen, by now into his 60s, was paroled from prison in February 2015, on life licence with conditions.\nIt was a catalyst for me making contact once again with Anita, who was still living in Folkestone.\nShe spoke of her anger at Bowen's release, and revealed he had requested mediation with her whilst in jail. She declined as he still wouldn't disclose her mother's whereabouts.\n\"I told them I only wanted to know why and where,\" she said. \"Unless he could tell me that I didn't want to meet him.\"\nAnita's experience led her to get involved with the campaign for Helen's Law - which aims to deny killers parole if they will not reveal where victims' remains are - set up in memory of murdered Helen McCourt, from Merseyside. The 22 year old's killer has never said where her body is.\nSpeaking to Anita shortly before Christmas in 2015, she told me she was about to become a grandmother - twice in the space of a few weeks - and was missing having her mum by her side for such a momentous life event.\nHaving lost my own mum by this time, I felt a renewed empathy for her - not being able to hold a funeral, grieve properly, observe all the usual conventions and processes that somehow propel you through the first weeks and months of losing a loved one.\nShe recalled, too, the impact on her own three boys: \"One day they had a nana and the next day they didn't. How do you explain that to very young children?\"\nThe cruelty of Anita's situation was reinforced by the irony that her mother's killer was by now a free man again.\nSo when news of the body in the reservoir came through earlier this year, my overriding emotion was hope that this would be the breakthrough Anita had craved.\nThere was also surprise, with the realisation that younger colleagues weren't familiar with the case. Some hadn't even heard of Sandie Bowen, despite the story popping up in the headlines every so often over the years.\nI text Anita saying I was thinking of her. \"I have everything crossed,\" she replied.\nDental records\nI sensed that police would be wary of raising Anita's hopes if they weren't fairly confident that this might be her mother.\nOn 9 March, police confirmed that the remains were those of Sandie Bowen, following analysis of dental records and DNA.\nAn inquest at Newport Coroner's Court heard that the body was exposed after the reservoir was drained for the first time in nearly a century.\nIt had been attached to a ceramic kitchen sink.\nThe inquest - its unlawful killing verdict by now a formality - nonetheless represented another step towards some kind of closure, peace of mind, for Sandie's family.\nAnd so I find myself at Sandie Bowen's funeral. I feel honoured to be here, the only journalist invited by the family to attend.\nIt's a small, simple affair: the final chapter of a story spanning two decades.\nThe people who loved her are reclaiming her from the lurid headlines and murder victim label at last.\nIt feels odd being here, for this woman I never knew, never met, yet know so much about, the intimate facts of her life laid bare on the page by me and so many others over the years.\nAnita travelled from Folkestone through the night for the service, with her partner Paul and three grown-up sons Sam, Ryan and Wesley.\nShe hugs me and I feel a wave of emotion.\nSandie is remembered as \"an adored Mum, Nan and friend to many\" a caring, friendly person who would help anyone.\nThere's a single hymn, 'All Things Bright and Beautiful,' and Elvis Presley's 'The Wonder of You' plays us out.\nSam, aged 10 when his grandmother vanished, now a strapping 30-year-old with a child of his own, props a photograph of him with Sandie on her coffin, a treasured memento he found only recently.\n\"I wanted a simple service, memories of happier times and not this miserable 20 years we've been put through,\" Anita tells me.\n\"It's hard to explain. Life has gone on, the children have grown up, and I'm in a better place now than I was, but I've always been living in the past, not having an end point.\n\"Now I can put it behind me. I've finally laid her to rest, which is what I've been waiting to do. I needed that closure.\"\nI ask how she feels about Mike Bowen today. Her response, unprintably vitriolic, confirms her earlier pledge: there will be no forgiveness.\nAnita plans to take her mum's ashes home and \"hang onto them for a bit, keep her close to me for a while\".\nShe may then scatter them someplace she and her mum spent time when she was a child.\nFriendship comes in many forms. Ours began in a courtroom, me with a notebook and pen in hand, Anita wracked with grief sitting behind me.\nIt's unconventional but feels like a friendship nonetheless.

The 22 year old's killer has never said where her body is.\nSpeaking to Anita shortly before Christmas in 2015, she told me she was about to become a grandmother - twice in the space of a few weeks - and was missing having her mum by her side for such a momentous life event.\nHaving lost my own mum by this time, I felt a renewed empathy for her - not being able to hold a funeral, grieve properly, observe all the usual conventions and processes that somehow propel you through the first weeks and months of losing a loved one.\nShe recalled, too, the impact on her own three boys: \"One day they had a nana and the next day they didn't. How do you explain that to very young children?\"\nThe cruelty of Anita's situation was reinforced by the irony that her mother's killer was by now a free man again.\nSo when news of the body in the reservoir came through earlier this year, my overriding emotion was hope that this would be the breakthrough Anita had craved.\nThere was also surprise, with the realisation that younger colleagues weren't familiar with the case. Some hadn't even heard of Sandie Bowen, despite the story popping up in the headlines every so often over the years.\nI text Anita saying I was thinking of her. \"I have everything crossed,\" she replied.\nDental records\nI sensed that police would be wary of raising Anita's hopes if they weren't fairly confident that this might be her mother.\nOn 9 March, police confirmed that the remains were those of Sandie Bowen, following analysis of dental records and DNA.\nAn inquest at Newport Coroner's Court heard that the body was exposed after the reservoir was drained for the first time in nearly a century.\nIt had been attached to a ceramic kitchen sink.\nThe inquest - its unlawful killing verdict by now a formality - nonetheless represented another step towards some kind of closure, peace of mind, for Sandie's family.\nAnd so I find myself at Sandie Bowen's funeral. I feel honoured to be here, the only journalist invited by the family to attend.\nIt's a small, simple affair: the final chapter of a story spanning two decades.\nThe people who loved her are reclaiming her from the lurid headlines and murder victim label at last.\nIt feels odd being here, for this woman I never knew, never met, yet know so much about, the intimate facts of her life laid bare on the page by me and so many others over the years.\nAnita travelled from Folkestone through the night for the service, with her partner Paul and three grown-up sons Sam, Ryan and Wesley.\nShe hugs me and I feel a wave of emotion.\nSandie is remembered as \"an adored Mum, Nan and friend to many\" a caring, friendly person who would help anyone.\nThere's a single hymn, 'All Things Bright and Beautiful,' and Elvis Presley's 'The Wonder of You' plays us out.\nSam, aged 10 when his grandmother vanished, now a strapping 30-year-old with a child of his own, props a photograph of him with Sandie on her coffin, a treasured memento he found only recently.\n\"I wanted a simple service, memories of happier times and not this miserable 20 years we've been put through,\" Anita tells me.\n\"It's hard to explain. Life has gone on, the children have grown up, and I'm in a better place now than I was, but I've always been living in the past, not having an end point.\n\"Now I can put it behind me. I've finally laid her to rest, which is what I've been waiting to do. I needed that closure.\"\nI ask how she feels about Mike Bowen today. Her response, unprintably vitriolic, confirms her earlier pledge: there will be no forgiveness.\nAnita plans to take her mum's ashes home and \"hang onto them for a bit, keep her close to me for a while\".\nShe may then scatter them someplace she and her mum spent time when she was a child.\nFriendship comes in many forms. Ours began in a courtroom, me with a notebook and pen in hand, Anita wracked with grief sitting behind me.\nIt's unconventional but feels like a friendship nonetheless. I hope we stay in touch.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "April 2017:  Gwent Crematorium, Cwmbran, south Wales."}

They took their roles as public defenders very seriously  - a move that might have angered the authorities, leading to a comprehensive crackdown that effectively shut down FengRui.\nLast year the authorities put out a statement accusing a group led by the Fengrui lawyers of illegally hiring protesters and swaying court decisions in the name of \"defending justice and public interests\".\nIt accused the group of organising more than 40 controversial incidents and severely disrupting public order, and gave an example in which it had allegedly presented a legitimate police shooting at a railway station as a murder conspiracy.\nIn July, the Chinese authorities launched what appeared to be an orchestrated campaign, when more than 280 human rights lawyers and activists - along with their associates - were summoned or detained or just disappeared. The arrests have been widely seen as the state's attempts to stifle dissent.\nLast month one of the country's most prominent rights lawyers, Pu Zhiqiang, received a suspended jail sentence after a brief trial for \"inciting ethnic hatred\" and \"picking quarrels\" in social media posts.\nRights group Amnesty International called that sentence \"a deliberate attempt by the Chinese authorities to shackle a champion of freedom of expression\".", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum", "label": "The Chinese authorities have arrested and charged at least seven human rights lawyers and associates with \"subversion\", friends and family say."}
