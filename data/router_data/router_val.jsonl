From 66‚Äì34 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45¬∞. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.

Context: As of April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7% of the entire student population. Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge \"attendance dues\" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2). Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.

{"text": "Question: Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events? Context: In the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this.

Context: Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What sort of engines utilized the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system? Context: It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered The Dating Game, a pioneer series in its genre, which was a reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions. This was followed up in July 1966 by The Newlywed Game, featuring three recently married couples who guessed the responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque). As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44 story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street (now occupied by The Financial Times's New York office).

{"text": "Question: In what two age groups is the strength of the immune system reduced? Context: Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production.

In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.

{"text": "Question: There have been major changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last how many years? Context: There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: Who works to get workers higher compensation? Context: A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: If you do not know both magnitude and direction of two forces on an object, what would you call that situation? Context: Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

The heads of government of member states also convene a \"European Council\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

{"text": "Question: Which is more costly, formal, or informal imperialism?

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What is included with each packet label Context: In connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information. The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number. Thus a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

Context: In 1993, Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development. A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.

{"text": "Question: By separating faith and reason, what does Luther honor? Context: Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. He wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" and \"[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.\" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100‚Äì150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth.

{"text": "Question: Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade? Context: Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have \"direct effect\". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‚Äòdirectly applicable in all Member States‚Äô. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion.

Context: This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.

General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales.

Nestorian graves dating to 1338‚Äì39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century.

Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.

As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification ‚Äì God's act of declaring a sinner righteous ‚Äì by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God's grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah. \"This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification,\" he wrote, \"is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.\"", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What compounds can be masked with the molecules of the host cell in order for a virus to evade detection? Context: The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\" structures.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: What probiotic flora is found in unpasteurized yogurt? Context: Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron. This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness. However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an \"overgrowth\" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection). There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What type of government investigations apply to civil disobedience? Context: Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\"", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place.

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally.

Cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall, which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes. Like chloroplasts, they have thylakoids within. On the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments, including chlorophyll a.

Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench.

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How long did Ms Kucukdeveci work for Swedex Gmbh & Co KG before she was dismissed? Context: First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called \"vertical\" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K√ºc√ºkdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code ¬ß622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K√ºc√ºkdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

{"text": "Question: What percent of the global assets in 2000 were owned by just 1% of adults? Context: A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size. Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice ‚Äî we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial ‚Äì The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants).

{"text": "Question: Why does competition among workers drive down wages? Context: A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How many votes in total does the Council have? Context: The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a \"European Council\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

{"text": "Question: Who does history view as accountable for the error Philip I made and Luther's advice in the matter? Context: From December 1539, Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who wanted to marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting. Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.

The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs. Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design.

This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: \"It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace.\" He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.

Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What does colonialism lack that imperialism has? Context: The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: Who formed the universal theory of gravitation? Context: The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.

Context: \"The word ‚Äòempire‚Äô comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‚Äòsovereignty‚Äô, or simply ‚Äòrule‚Äô\". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: For whom was this new mass intended? Context: In response to demands for a German liturgy, Luther wrote a German Mass, which he published in early 1526. He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the \"simple people\", a \"public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.\" Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted \"everything that smacks of sacrifice\"; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread. He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, considered Luther's service too papistic; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass. Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed. To reach the simple people and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism. He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How much larger would cicada predator populations be if cicada outbreaks occurred at 14 and 15 year intervals? Context: The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How many receptors on a helper T cell must be bound to a MHC:antigen complex in order for the cell to be activated? Context: Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200‚Äì300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What is unique about  simultaneous hermaphrodites? Context: Most species are hermaphrodites‚Äîa single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape.

{"text": "Question: What compounds are released by injured or infected cells, triggering inflammation? Context: Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection. The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: How does most plants' cpDNA replicate? Context: One of competing model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4. It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand. When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --> G gradients seen in plastomes. Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: Of what is ozone a reactive part of oxygen? Context: Trioxygen (O\n3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O\n2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O\n2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O\n4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O\n2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O\n8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O\n2 or O\n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Which TFEU article defines the ordinary legislative procedure that applies for majority of EU acts? Context: To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

Context: As a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors. However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda.

{"text": "Question: What co-receptor recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for cell activation? Context: Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200‚Äì300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states.

This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

{"text": "Question: What does  mnemiopsis eat? Context: Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: What can result in more equal distribution of income? Context: Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How did the education during the high school education movement differ from the subsequent high school education? Context: During the mass high school education movement from 1910‚Äì1940, there was an increase in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work.

This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. Alternatively, tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.

{"text": "Question: How can any knot be distinctively indicated? Context: The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a \"motivational embellishment\"; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material.

{"text": "Question: Which newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands? Context: In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required ¬£1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around ‚Ç¨27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in √úberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat√≥ √©s Szolg√°ltat√≥ bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How many people may have lived in the Amazon region during AD 1500?

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj√≥, and inland dwellers.

{"text": "Question: Which genus of ctenophores does not have cydipped-like larvae? Context: Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small ‚Äì so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: During withdrawal from Fort William Henry, what did some Indian allies of French do? Context: French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies, angered at the lost opportunity for loot, attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations; as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: Some have generalized the meaning of the word imperialism down to general-purpose what? Context: The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty.

{"text": "Question: What do bundle sheath chloroplasts specialize in? Context: As a result, chloroplasts in C4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store CO2 in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks‚Äîthough bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I‚Äîthe only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.

Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\" Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.

The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond order of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low œÉ and œÉ* orbitals; œÉ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and œÄ overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest œÄ and œÄ* orbitals.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: What are the Siouan-speaking tribes? Context: Further south the Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawba, Muskogee-speaking Creek and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes. When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee ‚Äì until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

{"text": "Question: In the Rankine cycle, in what state is the working fluid received in the condenser? Context: The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS (\"zeal\"), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada.

The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process.

{"text": "Question: What entity is created if the three different institutions cannot come to a consensus at any stage? Context: To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties.

Although the Mongols had ruled territories including today's North China for decades, it was not until 1271 that Kublai Khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional Chinese style. His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia and Korea. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.

Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. \"cultural revolution\", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric).

{"text": "Question: What kind of division of power did Kublai's government have? Context: The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: Ê®ûÂØÜÈô¢) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of K√ºl√ºg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What does Paul Krugmen think has had an observable effect on inequality in the U.S.? Context: Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper‚ÄìSamuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price? Context: In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Coke was then \"set apart\" as a superintendent (bishop) by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there. In defense of his action to ordain, Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria, which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore, bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate.

{"text": "Question: What protein does Staphylococcus aureus produce to make antibodies ineffective? Context: An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey ‚Äì some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled \"cydippid\" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes.

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of \"Social Darwinism\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

{"text": "Question: When was the first known historical reference to immunity? Context: Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.[citation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: What does ATP mean? Context: Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: About how many cubic meters of make-up water is used by a 700-megawatt coal-fired power plant for evaporative cooling hourly? Context: Where CHP is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Which entity is the secondary legislative body? Context: The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a \"European Council\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.

Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O\n2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them.

Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What commission was censured in 1999, and paved the way for Commissioners to abuse their power? Context: Commissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‚Äòeven the slightest sense of responsibility‚Äô. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a ‚Ç¨60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro. It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council, on the Council's recommendation. The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings, but do not have voting rights.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges.

High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down.

Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown. Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and \"Islamization\" or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his \"official state ideology\". Zia ul Haq was an admirer of Mawdudi and Mawdudi's party Jamaat-e-Islami became the \"regime's ideological and political arm\". In Pakistan this Islamization from above was \"probably\" more complete \"than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan,\" but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing \"symbols\" rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power. Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to \"avoid revolutionary excess\", and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies.

{"text": "Question: What happens if a member doesn't vote the party line?

Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare.

The rector of Edinburgh University presides over the institution's governing body.\nInevitably, some rectors play a largely symbolic role - in 2014 students at Glasgow University elected whistleblower Edward Snowdon who is currently claiming asylum in Russia - and on occasions, celebrities and public figures have been elected.\nOther rectors, however, are in a position to try to be proactive champions of the students' interests.\nRectors are elected at the four ancient universities - Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and Aberdeen - and also at Dundee. The University of the Highlands and Islands has a rector although the role there is different .\nIn his inauguration speech, Mr Morrison said he believed other Scottish higher education institutions should follow Edinburgh's example and warned proposed changes to the way universities are governed could end the role of the rector..\nOne proposal in the bill is to directly elect the chairs of each university's governing body, but some critics claim these elections could involve people other than students and staff.\nMr Morrison said: \"Every student and every member of staff, academic and non-academic, has the right to vote for the rector who presides over the governing body of the university - that is our inclusive Edinburgh model.\n\"I respectfully propose that every Scottish higher education institution should follow this example when electing the chair.\"\nThe Scottish government insisted it did not intent to abolish the position of rector at universities. A spokesman said: \"The Scottish government recognises the contribution made by rectors.  Over the summer, we have been talking to all higher education stakeholders, including current rectors, about their views on how a model for elected chairs of court might work in practice.\n\"As the Higher Education Bill progresses through parliament, we will continue to listen to all constructive views and suggestions made.\"\nThe Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Bill would require governing bodies to include at least two members directly elected by staff, and two members each nominated by trade unions, students' unions and alumni associations.\nThe proposal that the chairs of the governing bodies be chosen through an election has proved controversial and led to claims that it could involve voters from outside the university.\nCritics have also argued that trade union representatives could be torn between the interests of their members and the interests of the institution.\nAs well as a rector, Edinburgh University also has a vice convener who chairs several of the university's most important committees and helps hold the Principal to account.\nMr Morrison is a graduate of Edinburgh University and was the first student to run to become rector in the 1960s.\nHe later became the director of programmes and then chief executive of Granada Television.

Perhaps dozens, perhaps none.\nThere is also no scientific way of measuring how many potential violent extremists have now been shut out of the US because of the order.\nBut one thing is clear: in the ever-shifting ideological battle to win hearts and minds, this is one-nil to the extremists of so-called Islamic State (IS).\nIran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, whose country is currently helping Iraqi forces drive out IS, said the US move would \"be recorded in history as a great gift to extremists and their supporters\".\nHe added that it \"only serves to provide a fertile ground for more terrorist recruitment by deepening the ruptures and fault-lines which have been exploited by extremist demagogues\".\nIn Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, a foreign ministry spokesman said it deeply regretted the move \"because we believe it would affect the global fight against terrorism√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ It is wrong to link radicalism and terrorism with one particular religion\".\nEven America's closest ally, Britain, has been critical. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that in his personal view the move \"is divisive, discriminatory and wrong\".\nBehind the scenes, where the ideological battle against violent extremism is fought in internet chatrooms, over anti-terrorist hotlines, and with tip-offs from the public, one effect of the immigration order will be to, at least temporarily, inhibit co-operation between the US and the very countries whose help it needs in fighting Islamic extremism.\nIraq, whose forces have undergone an extensive retraining programme with help from US advisers, has been quick to retaliate by imposing similar restrictions on US visitors.\nAt street level, anything that portrays the US government as being anti-Muslim - and that is exactly how this is going down in much of the Middle East - makes it harder to fight the narrative of IS and other extremists.\nLargely obscured by the tumult and confusion over President Trump's Executive Order is one simple, compelling fact: the people whose actions bear the original blame for much of the mistrust and negative stereotyping of Muslims, on both sides of the Atlantic, are not the mainstream Muslim populations themselves.\nIt is the extremists from al-Qaeda, IS, al-Shabab and other affiliate groups who have waged violent jihad in the name of their common religion.\nThrough their actions, these extremists are looking to separate Muslims from non-Muslims and to create a gulf between them. They crave a return to a time when much of the inhabited world was divided into Dar al-Islam (lands inhabited and ruled by Muslims according to Sharia, Islamic law) and Dar al-Harb (literally \"the House of War\", meaning all the other lands).\nAnything that helps polarise the world's populations further down this path of segregation and an \"us and them\" mentality is welcomed by the extremists.\nWhen refugees surged out of Syria and headed west towards Europe instead of into the self-styled IS caliphate centred on Raqqa, IS's leadership was baffled and angry, viewing this as treachery.\nThe executive order on immigration now risks playing into their hands.\nAs IS finds itself ruling an ever-shrinking area of territory in the Middle East, it can be counted on to take maximum advantage of this latest development to recruit new followers and urge existing ones to carry out attacks.\nSome of those may already be living inside the United States.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

One couldn't persuade a sizeable chunk of his own MPs to back a key part of the coalition's policy programme.\nThe other has failed the first test in delivering what he hoped would be a key legacy of his time in office.\nThe more Machiavellian view is of a prime minister who sanctioned a soft whipping operation and who wanted to see the prospect of an insurrection in the 100+ category.\nAnd also of a man who is content to present his coalition partner with the harsh reality of another delay on the road to reforming the Lords.\nBut critics said the whole future of the bill has been thrown into doubt by the government's decision not to put a so-called programme motion to a vote. This would have limited the time for future debate on the proposed changes in the House of Commons to 10 days.\nThe government had been facing defeat on the vote and Lib Dem sources say Prime Minister David Cameron told his deputy Nick Clegg that the timetabling motion should be pulled to gather support for it among Conservatives over the next two months.\nBBC political editor Nick Robinson said a spokesman for Mr Clegg had declared \"a plague on both their houses\" when asked whether he blamed the Conservatives or Labour for the setback.\nLabour and rebel Conservative MPs said this did not allow enough time to discuss a crucial constitutional change.\nCommons leader Sir George Young told MPs the timetabling vote would be postponed until after the summer recess.\nHe blamed Labour for the climbdown, saying the opposition was not prepared to support the government in Tuesday's vote despite supporting the idea of changes to the Lords. \"It needs those that support reform to vote for reform,\" he said.\nThe government \"remain committed to making progress\" on changing the composition of the Lords, he stressed.\nResponding to the setback, Foreign Secretary William Hague said all parties must \"try to establish a better consensus\", while former Lib Dem minister David Laws said it was \"frustrating\" but the government would return to the issue in two months and \"expect to win\".\nBut Tory MP Conor Burns resigned from his position as a ministerial aide in the Northern Ireland Office in protest at the plans.\nAnd Tory backbencher Jesse Norman said the government had backed down because of the scale of the likely rebellion on the Conservative benches and the proposals were now a \"dead duck\".\nAnd Bernard Jenkin, one of the leading Conservative opponents of the plans, questioned the future of the entire legislation.\n\"Whatever moral authority the bill had, it has now lost,\" he said.\nLabour described the decision not to press ahead with a vote on the issue of the time allocated for debate as a \"victory for Parliament\".\n\"This is not a wrecking tactic - far from it,\" said shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan. \"We've already given our assurances we'll do all we can to ensure the bill progresses.

When you book a rail ticket, whether it's in a station or online, people should be given the cheapest price available at that time for their chosen journey.\n\"These changes will not make that happen. While it is certainly a move in the right direction, people cannot have the confidence that if they book a ticket, they will be paying the best price,\" he said.\nThe price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year.\nThe rise led to protests by passengers and rail unions.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The Home Affairs Committee said ministers were not working properly with their own expert drug advisers.\nThe MPs also said past governments' spending on education about the dangers of so-called legal highs had been \"shockingly inadequate to date\".\nPolicing minister Mike Penning said the government would consider the committee's criticism.\nNew psychoactive substances (NPS) are products chemically designed to mimic drugs that are already banned. Some 67 deaths in England and Wales last year were linked to their use.\nThe substances have been typically known as \"legal highs\", but in most cases they had only remained lawful because there had been no scientific testing and advice leading to a ban.\nOne hundred new NPS products were identified across the EU last year and legislation going through Parliament will create a blanket ban on all of them and their successors. These measures, based on a law from Ireland, will replace the current system of banning substances one at a time.\nBut the MPs said that the Psychoactive Substances Bill was being rushed amid a lack of clarity over whether it could actually work.\nThe committee also said it opposed plans to ban \"poppers\", a substance often used recreationally and referred to as a \"party drug\".\nPoppers, the name given to a group of chemicals called alkyl nitrites, are normally sniffed from a bottle producing a short head-rush. The Home Office has said they will be covered by the new laws.\nBut the committee referred to the conclusion of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that the misuse of poppers was \"not seen to be capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a societal problem\".\nKeith Vaz, the committee's chairman, said: \"Britain uses more psychoactive substances than any other country in Europe and is at risk of being overwhelmed by the sheer scale of this problem.\n\"Legislating on this issue is the right thing to do, however doing so at speed without any consultation may be counter-productive.\n\"The concerns expressed have been dealt with in a piecemeal manner and there has been unsatisfactory communication with the Advisory Council [on the Misuse of Drugs], the very body that the ministers should rely on for advice.\"\nThe MPs said there had been no clarity on the relative harm of different types of NPS - and therefore what kind of sentences courts should impose on future offenders.\nAnd they also attacked ministers for failing to do enough to warn young people of the dangers of the substances.\n\"Successive governments' spending on education on the dangers of NPS has been shockingly inadequate to date,\" said the report.\n\"Action must be taken now, to educate young people about NPS, through stronger and wider public information campaigns.\n\"There is substantial evidence that the market for NPS is already moving online, which, due to the anonymity that the internet can provide, is a challenge for prosecuting authorities to monitor and control.\"\nMr Penning said: \"The landmark Psychoactive Substances Bill will fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances - and put an end to the game of cat and mouse in which new drugs appear on the market more quickly than government can identify and ban them.\n\"The blanket ban will be on the production, supply and importation of these harmful substances, which caused the unnecessary and tragic deaths of 129 people in the UK last year.\n\"Unscrupulous suppliers will not be able to hide online, as our bill will give police the power to shut down websites trading in these potentially dangerous drugs.\"\nBut the homeless charity Centrepoint, which works with many young people who have used NPS products, said the proposed blanket ban was not enough.\n\"\"The young people most at risk need much more than the √Ç¬£180,000 the government has spent to date on educating them about legal highs,\" said Jennifer Barnes, the charity's head of policy. \"That is why we are calling on government to put their money where the ban is and back up this tough legislation with an approach to treatment and education which recognises the complex causes of substance use.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I don't think they know much about this region, and we need to try and show them what we are, what we do. The Chinese are everywhere. I think they are great explorers,\" said Motebang Mokoaleli, from Lesotho's National Development Corporation.\nBut if American business people are thin on the ground in Lesotho - and the only one we could find was running the local grain mill - it does not necessarily follow that American influence is small here.\nThe biggest employer in the country is the garment manufacturing industry, housed in warehouses on the edge of Maseru. Some 40,000 locals are currently working here, many for wages of little more than $3 (√Ç¬£2) a day.\nNone of the workers I spoke to had any idea that the tracksuits they were stitching together were all heading for the United States.\nTheir work is a direct result of America's African Growth and Opportunities Act (Agoa), which offers tax breaks to support manufacturing in a select group of African countries and is single-handedly responsible for the garment industry's success in Lesotho.\nBut, unsurprisingly, it is business people from the Far East, and in particular from Taiwan, who are taking advantage of Agoa to build and run the sector in Lesotho.\n\"This is my second home now,\" said Jennifer Chang, owner of the Shinning Century factory.\n\"We're not the enemy.

Here, too, was another example of America's hugely significant, but largely arms-length, support for Lesotho.\nThrough a range of programmes, not least the long-running Pepfar initiative, the US has poured huge sums into fighting the virus, which is currently thought to affect some 23% of the population (the second highest rate in the world).\n\"Generosity.

{"text": "The Shakespeare Schools Festival - an initiative which inspires schoolchildren to perform abridged versions of the playwright's famous work.\nFrom small beginnings, the initiative has grown into the UK's largest youth drama festival.\nAnd as the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death is marked on 23 April, we take a look back at its inception.\n\"It all started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989,\" co-founder Chris Grace explained.\nAs S4C's co-founder and director of animation, he had already made a name for himself kickstarting the Welsh animation industry with SuperTed and Fireman Sam.\nBut as eastern Europe opened up, he was inspired by innovative Soviet techniques which used models, drawings and oil on glass.\n\"I knew there was a Soviet tradition of animation which was totally different to Disney and it opened my eyes to new ways of making content accessible,\" he said.\n\"I saw that Shakespeare could be a bridge between east and west; between Soviet tradition and western tradition.\"\nWorking in Moscow, he helped to create 12 half-hour abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays  - not an easy task when trying to maintain the original dialogue - with each one costing ¬£500,000 to make.\nIt was a turbulent time, with production surviving two attempted presidential coups - against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 and Boris Yeltsin in 1993.\nOn one occasion, filming had to be stopped as tanks rumbled by outside, shaking the studio.\nOn another, the studio came under fire from rebels, with bullet holes peppering the walls.\n\"It was very exciting on one level because it was a new Europe,\" he said.\n\"But it was also fearful. You didn't know the price of bread let alone what the cost of production was.\n\"Despite this, we established a really strong production and international friendship between Wales and Russia.\"\nThe 12 films, known as S4C's Shakespeare: The Animated Tales, were created in Welsh and English. Initially launched at the Royal Academy in London and City Hall in Cardiff, they went on to be released in 70 countries and won three Emmy awards.\nBy the late-1990s, the films had a \"huge up-take\" in schools, introducing pupils to Shakespeare \"for the very first time\".\n\"Everybody wants something new, especially critics, and animation had never been seen in this way before,\" Mr Grace said.\n\"Part one was making Shakespeare accessible through a contemporary medium and part two was to take those films being used by schools and make Shakespeare accessible to young people through performance.\n\"I thought, 'if they're watching them, why can they not perform them?'\"\nAnd so, in 2000, the festival was officially launched.\nLiving in Pembrokeshire, he arranged for eight schools to perform at the Torch Theatre in Milford Haven.\nEach performed a half-hour play to sell-out audiences over two nights.\n\"It's not often we get things first in Pembrokeshire, so being the venue for a national debut felt like a major honour.\n\"Our director was a bit individual, not to mention notorious in my family for constantly giving me detentions, and she decided to set a Japanese theme around this classic love story from Verona.\n\"When not on stage, all the cast had to stand rigidly around the edge of the stage and even in an abridged version this was pretty uncomfortable.\n\"Despite the strains of performing I remember the cast getting along very well. One of the twins playing Juliet had a brief romance with an actor other than Romeo, while I quietly held a candle for Lady Capulet until she moved to a different school years later - parting is such sweet sorrow, as someone once wrote.\n\"There was a palpable sense of achievement on the final night as the applause rang out.\n\"Seeing it carry on and spread across the country should be a point of pride for all the pupils involved.\"\n\"The theatre had seen a lot of Shakespeare already but this was something completely different; eight schools performing eight Shakespeare plays.\n\"I thought it was a bold idea but what appealed to me was this idea of schoolchildren learning and really engaging with Shakespeare.\n\"It was quite difficult because you have to tell a story within half an hour but that's part of its success. It has to be told in a very short and simple way.\n\"The theatre was filled with mums, dads, aunts, uncles and grandparents. There was a real buzz around the place.\n\"It proved just how well it could work.\"\n\"One play I remember in particular was Romeo and Juliet in which they wore Japanese costumes,\" Mr Grace recalled.\n\"They used the technique of kneeling down and drumming the floor with their hands to create the atmosphere of fighting.\n\"Then, when Juliet committed suicide, the young girl ripped a huge tear in her kimono.\n\"The quality of each performance was outstanding.\"\nThe idea of children performing Shakespeare grew from there - by 2001 it had expanded to London, a year later to the whole of Wales and by 2007 right across the UK.\nThe festival even spread its roots to South Africa in 2011 and has since expanded to schools in five cities.\nFast forward to 2016 and 30,000 pupils from more than 1,000 primary, secondary and special schools are set to perform in 130 theatres all over the UK, including 15 in Wales.\nIts success has won the support of high-profile patrons, including Oscar winner Dame Judi Dench, dramatist Sir Tom Stoppard and author Philip Pullman.\n\"Children feel clever for having learnt the language and cracked it, while teachers say they are amazed to see children who are shy and mute come alive on stage,\" Mr Grace said.\n\"I think it's important because Shakespeare is a part of our legacy and our cultural heritage. His stories are as relevant now as when they were first written.\n\"The themes, the characterisation, the humour, the drama; it's all as alive now as it was all those years ago.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Early thinking suggested it might only be a relatively small lens of water.\nThis new result, published in the journal Icarus, is the best evidence yet that the sub-surface sea is not regional in nature, but encircles the entire globe.\nIt is significant because it makes it more possible that Enceladus is a habitable world.

But until then, BT was the only broadcaster transmitting 4K content to UK audiences and its offering was often limited to one football match a week.\nOther alternatives include a limited number of shows and films on streaming services including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and YouTube.\nCurrys PC World - which is owned by DSG Retail - screened the most recent of the two offending adverts on 4 June, six days before the Uefa (Union of European Football Associations) competition began.\n\"We know some people will do whatever it takes to watch the football on the right TV,\" stated the voiceover, before providing details of two 4K televisions.\nThe advert did not explicitly refer to Euro 2016, but the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) noted that it had contained a graphic of a rotating football made up of the flags of the various competing teams.\nPart of the store's defence was that, even though the Euro 2016 games were not broadcast in 4K, the TVs had the ability to \"upscale\" the footage to improve picture quality.\nThis involves using software to infer what each of the extra pixels should show, rather than just making each square of four pixels the same colour.

This, it explained, implied there was no guarantee that consumers would actually be able to see content in the format.\nHowever, the ASA rejected these responses saying it still felt consumers were likely to have believed they could watch the matches in \"genuine 4K definition\".\nIts verdict followed an earlier ruling against a Currys PC World ad that had said Ultra HD TVs allowed families to watch their \"favourite Christmas movies in greater detail\".\nThe firm had again justified its description by pointing to the sets' upscaling abilities.\nBut the ASA said it believed viewers had been misled to believe they would be able to see the films in \"full\" 4K quality and added that if the firm meant to refer to upscaling, it should be clearer about the fact.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Will he be less outspoken? Will he temper his Twitter tirades? Will he back down from his calls for a Muslim ban?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nBut there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.\nHere are five.\nMr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\"\nEven though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.\nNow, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (√Ç¬£307,850) per person.\nMr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.\nMr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.\n\"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\"\nIn fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.\n\"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThat was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.\nAccurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.\nAt least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.\nLike many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.\n\"I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,\" he said in October. \"Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.\"\nPart of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\"I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,\" he said in January. \"In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.\"\nThen Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.\nHis campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.\nThis, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents \"the natural maturation of the campaign\".\nOver the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.\n\"They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'\" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. \"And they let us down.\"\nNow Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and \"planted seeds\" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\nOn Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.\nIn the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.\nWhile one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.\nIt looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.\nAll of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.\nWhile no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.\nThat may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Iowa generated 32% of their electricity in 2015 from wind, up from 8% in 2008.\nOn the Paris climate agreement, Mr Obama said this was a \"fundamental shift in the diplomatic landscape which has already yielded substantial dividends\".\nPulling out of the agreement, as Mr Trump has mulled doing, would see the United States lose its seat at the table, and be unable to hold other countries to their commitments, the President wrote. Continued participation in the Paris process, Mr Obama said, would yield great benefit for the American people and the international community.\nHowever, the outgoing president was careful to offer an olive branch of sorts to President-elect Trump. Mr Obama argued that the targets that the US signed up to in the Paris agreement could be achieved in many different ways and \"this does not mean that the next Administration has to follow identical domestic policies\".\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Interestingly, the fractures tend to be perpendicular to the direction of the waves, and to be of even widths.\"\nComputer modellers have been trying to simulate the recent trends in polar sea ice - without a great deal of success.\nThey have failed to capture both the very rapid decline in summer ice cover in the Arctic and the small, but nonetheless significant, growth in winter ice in the Antarctic.\nDr Kohout and colleagues say their experiments offer some clues - certainly in the south.\nWhen they compared observed Antarctic marine-ice edge positions from 1997 to 2009 with likely wave heights generated by the weather during that period, they found a strong link.\nFor example, where storminess was increased, in regions like the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, ice extent was curtailed.\nIn contrast, where wave heights were smaller, such as in the Western Ross Sea, marine ice was seen to expand.\nOne very noticeable aspect of the recent growth in Antarctic winter sea ice has been its high regional variability.\nThe team says that if models take more account of wave heights then they may better capture some of this behaviour.\nThe group did try to look for a similar relationship in storminess and ice extent in the Arctic but found there to be insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions.\nThe geography at the poles is quite different. The Arctic is in large part an ocean enclosed by land, whereas the Antarctic is a land mass totally surrounded by ocean. Many of the ice behaviours and responses are different as a result.\n\"I think what's interesting for us in the Arctic is that the 'fetch' is increasing - the distance from the shores to the ice edge is increasing,\" commented Prof Julienne Stroeve from University College London and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\"That would allow the wind to work more on the ocean to produce larger waves that can then propagate further into the ice pack.\n\"[Another recent paper has already suggested] that wave heights are going to change with increasing distance from the ice edge to the land, and that could have more of an impact on ice break-up.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Up to now it was only council tenants who had the right to buy the homes they had previously rented. But when the Housing Bill becomes law housing association tenants will acquire that same right.\nAs a scheme already rejected by the Scottish and Welsh governments, who wish to preserve publicly-owned housing stock, it is also emblematic of the different directions being taken by different parts of the United Kingdom.\nPotential buyers must have been tenants for at least three years, the same as with council tenants. The government says that means up to 1.3m housing association tenants will be eligible in England. Around 500,000 housing association tenants are already eligible for some discounts. So the new scheme will extend rights to a further 800,000 tenants, and increase the discounts available. In Wales the government is planning to abolish Right to Buy entirely, and in Scotland it will be phased out by August 2016. A separate scheme exists in Northern Ireland.\nFor those eligible, discounts start at 35% on a house and 50% on a flat. The maximum is 70%, but that is currently capped at ¬£77,900 outside London, and ¬£103,900 in the capital. For example, someone who has been a public sector tenant for ten years could buy a ¬£100,000 flat for just ¬£40,000 - using a 60% discount.\nUnder the government's new Housing Bill, Local Authorities will be required to sell off their most valuable council houses, whenever they become vacant. The government estimates this would raise ¬£4.5bn. The councils will then have to build replacement homes with the money raised, and the surplus will be used to fund Right to Buy. The government will make up any difference.\nThe government hasn't yet said what this policy will cost the taxpayer, but it has promised to refund the discount to the housing association involved. The National Housing Federation (NHF) which represents all the UK's housing associations, has calculated that in total Right to Buy for housing association tenants might cost ¬£11.2bn, if all those tenants who could afford to buy did so. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said it would potentially cost \"billions of pounds\" over the next parliament, and it \"would worsen the UK's underlying public finance position\". The IFS said it would also represent a \"substantial giveaway\" to housing association tenants.\nThe government argues that by selling off housing association homes, but by requiring a replacement to be built, the scheme will, in effect, double the number of homes available. It will also raise the proportion of home-owners in England, which has fallen over the last few years. But the NHF argues that since 2012, only 46% of homes sold off have been replaced by new ones, despite a requirement for local authorities to do so. One problem is that councils - particularly those in urban areas - cannot find enough land to build on.\nAround 2.5m council tenants across the UK have bought their homes since Right to Buy started under Mrs Thatcher's government in October 1980. The numbers buying peaked at 167,000 in England in 1982/83, but fell to 3,179 in 2009/10. After the discounts were increased, sales went back up to more than 15,000 in 2013/14. The government hopes the number will now rise further.\nAround 15 to 35% of housing tenants eligible for the new scheme will be able to afford to pay a mortgage, according to the NHF.. That means around 221,000 households might be keen to take up the offer - but potentially fewer than that if mortgage rates begin to rise, as expected, over the next couple of years.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "But after an amazing Northern Ireland Assembly election result in the constituency in March, Sinn F√©in can see the summit.\nThe party began 155 votes behind the SDLP on the previous assembly poll result of May 2016.\nThey emerged 6,650 votes ahead.\nThat is why many believe Chris Hazzard, one of Sinn F√©in's two candidates in that election, is set to become the party's first MP for South Down.\nBut there is a caveat - or two.\nFirstly, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie easily beat Mr Hazzard in the 2015 general election - the margin was 5,891 votes.\nAnd, of course, there is the old claim that in Westminster elections many unionists lend their votes to the SDLP to ensure Sinn F√©in is defeated.\nRight? Well, maybe not this time.\nAccording to Paul Smyington, the editor of the Down Recorder newspaper, unionists who were spooked by the surge for Sinn F√©in in March are telling voters on the doorsteps to \"vote for the union\".\nHe claims that could have an \"important impact on this election\".\nNot that Ms Ritchie appeared bothered about the unionist factor two years ago.\nIn her victory speech, she told her supporters: \"Let us be very clear that the SDLP vote increased and that we have a solid majority now in South Down without any votes being lent to us.\n\"So, let's lose that myth now.\"\nThat claim is about to be put to the test.\nAsked about the forthcoming election, the outgoing SDLP MP chose her words carefully.\n\"I, as an MP who has served for the last seven years, have been an MP for all of the constituents in South Down, representing them on a wide range of issues,\" she said.\n\"Every vote is valued for me and I look forward to many, many people right across the constituency - irrespective of political affiliations - voting for Margaret Ritchie on 8 June.\n\"They will get an MP who will represent them both here in the constituency and at Westminster 24-7, 365 days per year.\"\nSinn F√©in has been putting a massive effort into the constituency.\nAbout 400 people, including the party president Gerry Adams, attended Mr Hazzard's campaign launch in Newcastle.\n\"When the results were coming in in March more people joined Sinn F√©in in the six hours during the count than had previously joined in the previous six months in South Down,\" said Mr Hazzard.\n\"There's an appetite now for Sinn F√©in that is growing year-on-year.\n\"We have canvas teams out in nearly every village and town every night and certainly the message coming back is positive.\n\"People see the work that we are doing, the leadership that we are giving and they're coming on board.\"\nThe largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, is not represented this time by the well-known Jim Wells but by a first-timer, 32-year-old accountant Diane Forsythe.\nShe said the election in March was a wake-up call for unionists.\n\"There's definitely that strong feeling that I'm getting on the doors that people are wanting to come out and put their pro-union support on the ticket,\" she said.\n\"I would ask them to do that because ultimately lending their vote to any nationalist party is a vote against the union.\"\nUlster Unionist Harold McKee, who lost his assembly seat in March, said the unionist mindset this time is difficult to read.\n\"I'm hearing mixed views on it,\" he said.\n\"I am a unionist and if I stand as a unionist I'll not be asking someone else to vote for another party - I expect them to vote for me.\"\nThe Alliance Party shocked many by out-polling the Ulster Unionists in March.\nIt is represented this time by councillor Andrew McMurray, who said the party has a \"solid base\".\n\"I think the positive, progressive and pro-European messages that we're putting out will hopefully resonate with the voters and they will show that South Down wants that Alliance voice.\"\nSinn F√©in knows that Ms Ritchie cannot be written off.\nBut coming so soon after the assembly election and the Sinn F√©in surge she will have to fight harder than ever if the SDLP's winning streak in South Down is to continue.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Public policy researcher Dr Mark Lang said his study in Pontypool, Torfaen, showed real diversity within a single town.\nWhat this type of \"deep place\" research does is look in fine detail at different neighbourhoods and avoid generalisations with both stereotypes and statistics.\nHe believes looking at economic data on too-wide a scale can miss entrenched pockets of poverty within communities, which on the face of it look to be doing well.\n\"Pontypool is a real mixture of people clearly with little money and people who are relatively affluent, living in close proximity,\" he said.\n\"Many of those who don't have a great deal of resources use the town centre while those who do have, tend by and large not to come here. As a focus of community attention, I think that's a shame.\"\nDr Lang, who has published similar work about Tredegar, is hoping the approach can help create jobs and revitalise town centres.\nPontypool is a town with a population of about 23,400, six miles south of the Blaenavon world heritage site.\nIts iron forging dates back to Tudor times and the \"Pontypool front row\" were Wales rugby stars the 1970s.\nNearly 3,700 people live on the Trevethin estate, over the Afon Lwyd river, which stands on a hill overlooking the town centre, a mile away.\nMore than half of those are in a part of the estate - classified as \"Trevethin 1\" - which all figures point to as being the poorest area.\nIt also has the densest population and the largest proportion (28.3%) of under-15s.\nPOCKETS OF POVERTY\nSource: All Around Us - The Pontypool Deep Place Study\nWhen looking at relative economic deprivation, Wales is split up into 1,900 different districts. \"Trevethin 1\" is classed as 35th most deprived in this often-used index.\nThree other districts in Pontypool come into the top 20% most deprived in Wales. Trevethin also scores 22nd worst in Wales when it comes to health factors.\nA total of 60% of housing in Trevethin is rented. There is plenty of visible work going on to improve housing by Bron Afon, the social enterprise which has rented homes in place of the council for the past eight years.\nTorfaen council, with ¬£8.2m from the Welsh Government's Vibrant and Viable places programme, has earmarked money for housing improvements and regenerating town centre properties.\nThis report points to the link between poverty and rent arrears - and there are 5,475 homes owing money in Trevethin.\nAt the heart of the report is the argument that local solutions are needed to tackle these very local problems. This means \"far greater empowerment\" of people and local communities.\nVIEWS FROM THE MARKET STALLS\nA key part of the report looked at Pontypool town centre, which \"needs to be designed as the heart of the community\" and its future prosperity will depend on local people's continued relationship with it.\nThis includes a \"concerted effort\" to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour to make it a place to go in the evenings.\nPontypool Indoor Market dates back more than 120 years but underwent a ¬£2.5m revamp in 2015, thanks in part to European regional funding.\nAs well as long-established stalls, there are new traders, cafes and a hairdressers.\nBut some traders want more to be done to attract people to the town centre, which faces competition from Cwmbran and Newport.\nThere is also unhappiness about the Tesco near the town's by-pass, meaning fewer shoppers come into the centre.\nThe report finds far fewer convenience shoppers in Pontypool than the average for small town centres, while footfall on a quiet day is a lot less than other towns of its size.\nSteve Harris turned his hobby for vinyl record collecting into a business after retiring from working in the health service after 35 years.\nHe has run his market stall for the past 18 months dealing in classic and rare records, as well as having an online side of the business.\n\"You see all sorts of people; there are shops which cater for people on lower incomes and more select shops that perhaps have a bit more spending power.\n\"People look for bargains and they have to but there are also niche shops like mine - I can have people on a Saturday who will spend ¬£150 on records.\n\"A lot of people in the town are working minimum wage or part time. People come and talk and listen to music - they don't buy anything but we offer a bit of a haven, just to chat.\n\"I've seen a change over the last five years - we're seeing, I guess, a slow accumulation of 30 years of slow, economic decline and the valleys themselves are very much like that. Pontypool isn't different to that extent.\"\nBeth White, 19, is the fourth generation of her family to have a stall at the market. Her great-grandmother started with a flowers, fruit and vegetables business in 1945. Lending a hand is her grandfather Charlie Murray, 77, just a boy when he started helping and who has seen some changes.\n\"You couldn't see across there [the market hall] for people at one time,\" said Mr Murray. \"You  could get a suit made up, all sorts. It's very different now - there are very few types of businesses which can make money.\"\nMiss White started running her flower stall in February.\n\"Funerals keep us going,\" she said. \"I had one this morning. We've got regulars but there's not a lot of walk-in traffic. Tesco killed things. Now with Brexit [and the value of the pound] - I've got two Dutch suppliers and so it's costing an extra ¬£1 a bunch for Chrysanthemums.\"\nTerry Baker's stall includes trading in DVDs and second hand books. He believes there has been no answer to bringing more traffic back into town since the by-pass was built.\n\"This town is marooned but people can still make a living,\" the 69-year-old said. \"I meet a lot of people, some people come for a chat and don't spend anything but there's money about. I make enough to make a wage every week.\"\nWHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN?\nDr Lang said work needed to be done to grow confidence: \"We need to send the message out that Pontypool is open for business.\"\nHe said there was potential for young, tech businesses to locate in the town centre. A third of people using the town centre at the moment do so because of work - mainly Torfaen council staff.\n\"It doesn't have to be a large business to be attracted here. If you look at young people and the kind of businesses they're starting up, often based online there's plenty of space and the costs of operating in Pontypool are so much lower than in a large city centre,\" said Dr Lang.\n\"It's those kind of ventures, creating economic activity, which could be so important for an area. Chicken follows egg, the economy will grow.\"\nMark Hooper from IndyCube is preparing to open a hub for small hi-tech businesses in a converted pub next to the market.\n\"It might be people who work in a back bedroom or from a coffee shop, but now they can work alongside other people in the centre of Pontypool,\" he said.\n\"We have 30 other places across Wales so we're really pleased to be here as well. People who wouldn't have worked together are sitting across from each other - and they start working with people who they like and trust.\n\"They don't have to go to Newport or Cardiff to work and then when they buy their bacon sandwich, they buy it from the market here.\"\nDr Lang said there was a \"big role\" for local authorities in driving progress forward with the private sector and Welsh Government needed to support them and take a step back.\nHe said poorer communities in Pontypool were too far distant to benefit from the impact of improvements to infrastructure to commute to work in the big cities.\nDr Lang, whose work has been supported by Cardiff University's Sustainable Places Research Institute, said there needed to be a better balance between the regional and city deal approach with a \"closer, harder look\" at existing local economies to create local employment.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "Lord Janner died at the end of last year, shortly after a judge had ruled that the he was not fit to stand trial for alleged child sex offences.\nBut a leading lawyer has told the BBC he sees \"a danger\" that the inquiry into Lord Janner's case may contravene the principles of a fair trial.\nAs part of her wider inquiry, Dame Lowell, who served as a judge in her native New Zealand, will investigate the way public bodies handled child sex abuse claims.\nShe will be holding further preliminary hearings this month into allegations of child sexual abuse involving the Anglican Church, Lambeth Council and a number of institutions in Rochdale.\nThe inquiry will consider the prevalence of abuse and the adequacy of child protection policies.\nAt this stage, though, it will not hear from witnesses.\nInstead, Dame Lowell has designated 17 complainants in the case as core participants, giving them access to relevant evidence and the opportunity to make opening and closing statements.\nCore participants will be able to ask for particular questions to be put to witnesses by the inquiry panel but they will not be allowed to question the witnesses directly.\nIn setting out the scope of the investigation, Dame Lowell says she will consider whether or not the allegations against Lord Janner are \"well-founded\".\nIt is only if particular allegations meet this test that she will go on to consider whether the various authorities concerned had failed in their responsibilities.\nThis suggests that she intends to hold what amounts to a trial without a defendant.\nLast April, her team said: \"If the evidence permits findings of fact to be reached concerning the allegations against Lord Janner, the inquiry will record and publish these findings.\"\nIf Lord Janner's criminal trial had gone ahead, prosecutors would have had to prove the allegations against him beyond reasonable doubt.\nHowever, it is thought that the Goddard inquiry will regard the allegations as well-founded if they can be proved on the balance of probabilities - the lesser standard of proof required in civil claims.\nAnother question for the inquiry is whether witnesses who claim they were abused by Lord Janner should be cross-examined, as they would have been at a criminal trial.\nUnless lawyers for the various core participants are willing to challenge the evidence given by individual witnesses, Dame Lowell may have to consider appointing independent lawyers for the purpose.\nThat's because the inquiry's findings may have a bearing on civil claims being made against the estate of Lord Janner and against the various public bodies that are accused of failing in their safeguarding duties.\nProf Sir Ian Kennedy QC, who chaired the public inquiry into child deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary which reported in 2001, said there was a danger that Lord Janner's case would become something like a trial.\nIn an interview for BBC Radio 4's Law in Action he said: \"The difficulty is that it can't really be a trial, as we would recognise it, because the person who is centre stage is no longer there.\n\"And that will pose very difficult questions about tackling the veracity or otherwise of witnesses.\"\nSir Ian asked whether anyone would represent Lord Janner's interests at the inquiry.\nHe concluded: \"There is a danger, if you convert it into a trial, of it contravening some of the principles which we normally associate with a trial.\"\nLord Janner's family have always denied the allegations against him.\nFor more on this story listen to Law in Action.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "After the blood-letting of the early part of the year following the Ashes, they have been desperate for some stability - to keep Alastair Cook in charge for the World Cup, which starts in February.\nBut following the 5-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka, their fourth in a row under Cook, the time has come to realise he is not the man to lead them in the tournament in Australia and New Zealand.\nHere are four reasons why.\nSince Cook took over as one-day captain in 2011, there have been changes to the one-day format - the introduction of two new balls, theoretically an advantage for bowlers, offset by the limitation to four of the number of men allowed on the boundary.\nScores have risen around the world (the average is about 270 now) and the number of totals of more than 300 has doubled. Openers who set out to bat the innings and make 100 should now look at a minimum of 150.\nCook does not have the proactive game for this objective. His last ODI hundred was 45 games ago, and he lacks the power and range to have a major impact.\nHis strike rate this year is only low 70s (openers need to have a minimum of 80). Being inventive does not come naturally and he can be controlled at the crease.\nThat is underlined by the relative statistics of Cook and other international openers over the past 12 months. He has by far the lowest combined average and strike rate (a reliable measure of the effectiveness of a batsman) and is therefore holding England back.\nOne-day internationals are very much pre-planned operations, organised in the dressing room. Batsmen know their specific roles, bowlers know roughly which overs they are going to bowl.\nODIs are much less free-flowing than Tests, therefore captaincy is a less vital influence. Every player must deserve his place in the team, there is no need to 'carry' a captain.\nThough he has been short of runs himself, Eoin Morgan is a must-pick for England and actually has excellent tactical nous and a calm demeanour (and plays well when he's in charge).\nAnd, as a middle-order player, he does not have to have half a mind on batting in those frenetic late overs of an innings in the field, which can be very distracting.\nMorgan is now playing in the Big Bash in Australia so will get advance preparation for the World Cup.\nBoth the England management and members of the team are nervous of jettisoning Cook because of the stability and reassurance he brings as a batsman and a man.\nThey are thinking particularly of England's first World Cup match against Australia in the MCG cauldron in front of 80,000 baying Aussies, and the need to send out at least one opener with authority and experience.\nBut this burden is playing heavily on Cook's mind and inhibiting him. He is so taut with determination, he can barely move to the ball. It is even affecting his fielding. The opposition almost feel sorry for him.\nHe has put so much effort in but it would be kindest now to set him free from this responsibility and leave him to concentrate on what he does best, which is score big Test hundreds.\nEngland have six serious games in Australia before the World Cup to allow a new opening partnership - Alex Hales and Moeen Ali, or, if you want more experience, Ian Bell and Moeen - to bed in. They cannot keep an underperforming player with just one match (v Australia) in mind.\nThe past two World Cup-winning teams averaged 138 (India) and 178 (Australia) one-day games per man. England's current side averages about 60 caps per man.\nIf England go with a relatively young side now they may only reach the quarter-finals but the experience will have been invaluable and that group will be nudging towards 150 caps per man when the next World Cup comes round in 2019.

The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere.\nSouth London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about √Ç¬£1.3m a week.\nThe problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form.\nMatthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services.\nIf implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver \"safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services.\"\nMr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not \"saddled with the issues of the past\".\n\"I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,\" his report said.\nIn November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event.

And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.\nAnd yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.\nTheir desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.\nBut it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.\nThe ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.\nThe introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.\nAgain his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.\nThat equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.\nThe Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.\nBut Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.\nMcInnes's assertion that they were deserved winners is a generous one, but they stuck steadfastly to their task and though Jonny Hayes' winner had a huge slice of luck attached to it, Aberdeen now have the opportunity to make amends for a tame League Cup final showing earlier in the season.\nAfter the match, Lennon declined to accept the tag of gallant losers, insisting his team were simply losers.\nIt's a harsh assessment but an indication of the standards the Hibs manager demands - and will continue to demand - from his side.\nLennon has not amassed the medals he has won as a player and manager by accepting second-best, which is what his side were by some distance in the opening half-hour.\nBut he can take solace - on reflection - in the manner his team dug in to give the country's second-best team quite a fright.\nHe can now turn his attention fully to building for next season's return to the Premiership. A few astute signings could ensure they are challenging in the upper half of the table this time next year.\nFor Derek McInnes, though, the short-term requires his full attention. Second place in the Premiership looks a safe bet, though not yet an absolute certainty.\nBut he and his players could make a real name for themselves back at Hampden on 27 May if they can end the 27-year wait to reclaim the Scottish Cup.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The health board apologised unreservedly for a \"terrible failure\".\nThe judge said: \"The inquiry has discovered serious personal and systemic failures.\n\"Patients at the Vale of Leven Hospital were badly let down by people at different levels of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde who were supposed to care for them.\"\nHe added: \"There were failures by individuals but the overall responsibility has to rest with the health board.\"\nLord MacLean said \"systems were simply not adequate to tackle effectively a healthcare associated infection\" like C. diff.\nHe added: \"The major lesson to be learned is that what happened at Vale of Leven Hospital to cause such personal suffering should never be allowed to happen again.\"\nLord MacLean also expressed his view that the figure of 34 deaths was probably an underestimate as medical records were not available for all of the patients during the period in question.\nHe cited poor facilities, such as a lack of wash hand basins and a lack of commodes, as well as issues with the fabric of the building as evidence of poor management.\nThe judge said that prolonged uncertainty over the future of the Vale of Leven hospital contributed to poor morale and recruitment.\nPoor leadership among NHS GGC managers, the judge said, contributed to substandard nursing care and deficiencies in medical staffing.\nHe said inexperienced junior doctors had too much responsibility and consultants were stretched.\nLord MacLean also said antibiotics were prescribed in cases where it was inappropriate.\nHis report identified a number of failings:\nThere are 75 recommendations in his report, including recommendations on infection prevention and control, nursing and medical care, antibiotic prescribing, communication with patients and relatives, and death certification.\nLord MacLean added: \"An effective inspection regime, I am convinced, would have been able to identify the dysfunctional nature of infection prevention and control at the hospital.\n\"There must be an effective line of reporting, accountability and assurance.\n\"This was lacking for the Vale of Leven Hospital.

As well as creating our implementation group, I am today writing to all health boards to ensure they review their services against the report and respond to the government within eight weeks.\"\nMs Robison acknowledged that Lord MacLean's report had shown \"a clear picture of the failings in the system that led to the C. diff outbreak\".\nThese included a \"lack of investment in the hospital, which was simply no longer fit for its purpose...a lack of managerial oversight and a fundamental breakdown in the links between what was happening at ward level and those in positions of authority at the board\".\n\"The report highlights those who either abdicated their responsibilities or failed to carry them out effectively,\" Ms Robison said.\n\"There is no place for this conduct in our NHS, which fell below even the minimum standards we expect. It is for the health board as the employer to consider the implications and we would expect them to consider the report's findings on this aspect urgently.\"\nThe outbreak of clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven hospital was one of several across the UK at the time.\nAuthorities often say that much has changed, but this time it really has.  Levels of C. difficile are 75% lower than they previously were.\nThis has been achieved through better hygiene and infection control, but by far the biggest impact in Greater Glasgow was made through a change in the kind of antibiotics prescribed.\nThe relatives of those who became ill, or died, rightly want to know why these changes weren't in place earlier.\nHowever, the public may end up asking a bigger question - whether it was worth √Ç¬£10m for an inquiry which took so long that by the time it reached its conclusions, the problem had already largely been fixed.\nThe health secretary noted that at the time of the outbreak, \"there was no effective inspection regime at the time to pick up these failings\".\n\"We now have an effective inspection routine through the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate that completes unannounced, comprehensive inspections and demands urgent actions,\" she said.\nMs Robison added: \"Our top priority is that lessons are learned so that what happened at the Vale of Leven can never be allowed to happen again.\"\nThe health secretary will give a ministerial statement on the inquiry on Tuesday afternoon, which can be watched live or on demand on BBC Scotland's Democracy Live website.\nA full Scottish government response to the report will be published in spring 2015.\nJackie Baillie, the Labour MSP for Dumbarton, said the findings had \"vindicated\" the families who had called for a public inquiry.\n\"The C. diff outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital was the worst in the UK due to the high mortality rate,\" she said.\n\"The families deserve nothing less than a full apology from the hospital management, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Scottish government for the mistakes which compromised patient care.\"\nShe added: \"What happened at the Vale of Leven should never be repeated anywhere in Scotland so it is vital we learn lessons and implement MacLean's recommendations in full.\"\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw, said the report would be \"extremely difficult reading\" for those who lost loved ones.\nHe said: \"Failing after failing is set out here, and there are very tricky questions for both the health board and the Scottish government.\"\nMr Carlaw said that as Scotland's new First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was health secretary from May 2007 she would \"have to explain why the infection control and inspection regimes were so inadequate, and why the Scottish government wasn't paying attention to lessons being learned south of the border\".\nHe added: \"Many of the recommendations set out will already have been acted upon, and I'm sure NHS staff across Scotland are absolutely committed to an outbreak like this never being repeated.\"\nDr Charles Saunders, chairman of the BMA's Scottish public health committee, said the report was \"uncomfortable reading for all of us involved in the provision of healthcare\".\n\"Whilst we recognise, since the beginning of this inquiry, a number of steps have been taken to improve patient safety and the standards of care, it is important that the NHS and the Scottish government are not complacent.\n\"Some of the circumstances that led to the challenges which were experienced at the Vale of Leven Hospital still exist, and not just in small district general hospitals.\"\nUnison regional organiser, Matt McLaughlin, said: \"It is fair to say that NHS Glasgow and Clyde has now put in place systems that would recognise a similar trend were it to occur today and this is to be welcomed.\n\"However, the report also identifies many issues that are sadly not uncommon across Scotland and that our nursing members have been raising for a long time: short staffing, lack of equipment, wrong skill mix and little or no extra staffing when clinical needs on the ward change.\"\nCampaigners frequently call for a public inquiry to be held following a scandal or tragedy.\nBut only four have been held since the current law governing them was passed in 2005.\nThe problem for the government is that inquiries are costly and lengthy.\nLord Penrose's inquiry into the infection of blood for transfusions with the hepatitis C virus has yet to report, although it has reportedly cost √Ç¬£12m and has taken five years so far.\nBut public inquiries, which are chaired by a judge, are able to make recommendations which become legally binding.\nDuring the ICL inquiry into the Stockline explosion, evidence about badly-maintained underground gas pipes prompted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to inspect other premises and issue enforcement notices.\nIn 2012 the Scottish government announced it would consult on improvements to the public inquiry system to make them more responsive, quicker and cheaper.\nBut nothing has so far been done.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "When we flick the light switch or kettle, ancient plant and animal material, that formed hundreds of millions of years ago, are consumed in an instant.\nThe ancient geological past is powering the present, but for how much longer?\nHow ironic that our modern world is so hopelessly wedded to a substance that began life tens of millions of years ago.\nAnd yet it is the liberation of that fossil solar energy tens of millions of years later that transformed the planet and redefined us as a species.\nIt is that transformation that I'm fascinated by and why I wanted to make this three-part series about our addiction to crude and to help me answer a fundamental question.\nWhen did planet Earth become Planet Oil?\nIt's a series that's also been a personal journey.\nMy childhood and teenage years were spent oblivious to the stunning advances in petroleum science and technology that evolved furiously to exploit the buried bonanza off our shores.\nI was born in November 1964.\nA huge gas field had been discovered off the coast of Holland a few years earlier and geologists soon worked out that the very same hydrocarbon-bearing rocks ran all the way to the British coast.\nBy December 1964, the race was on to find oil and gas in the British sector of the North Sea.\nThe well drilled that winter was dry. But the following year, the Sea Gem drilling platform hit pay dirt, or rather natural gas.\nThe euphoria was short lived after disaster struck on Boxing Day 1965, with 14 men losing their lives.\nIt was an inauspicious start of what would become an engineering revolution that turned the UK's energy fortunes around.\nBy the time I was starting primary school, attention had shifted to the deeper waters northeast of Aberdeen and the first oil fields had been found - Brent and Forties - so-called \"giant\" fields that rivalled those of the Middle East.\nMy school days were punctuated by evening news footage of the latest platform being dragged out of yards and off to the wilds of the North Sea.\nAs a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 20-year-old geology student, my subject always seemed to be in the news.\nDuring the early 80s, Margaret Thatcher was at war with coal, or rather Britain's miners.\nThatcher had vowed the UK's coal supply would never again be held to ransom by the National Union of Mineworkers and I remember at the time, it was like watching a fight to the death.\nBritish governments had been here before, during the 1970s, but this time the balance of power had shifted.\nBritain was no longer dependent on British Coal or the workers who mined it.\nThatcher's pledge to build more oil and gas-fired power stations helped put an end to both the strike and many of the mines that had fed the UK's insatiable appetite for coal for more than a century.\nAnd the prime minister's promise was made in the knowledge Britain was for the first time in decades, energy secure - because the UK now belonged to a very exclusive club.\nThe North Sea was producing so much crude oil; we had become a net exporter and the wealth it generated flooded into the UK treasury.\nBritain was awash with oil money.\nThe economy was booming.\nSo much so, that by the mid-80s, most of the students I shared my geology course at university with were immediately recruited into the swelling ranks of the offshore energy industry.\nI took a different route, following an academic career that now finds me training students for geo-science careers, many of whom will go into the industry.\nBut in all other aspects I am a product of our homegrown hydrocarbon age - tupperware parties - polyester and new materials - fertilisers - I am Hydrocarbon Man.\nAs we show in this series, crude oil is a fuel which has come to dominate both our daily lives and the modern world.\nIt's also been used as a powerful weapon in international politics.\nFor much of the 20th century, global history and the environment were shaped by nation states whose acquisitive and aggressive foreign policies were determined by unsustainable economic growth and energy consumption.\nAs carbon energy sources became finite and the oil producing nations struggled to take back control of their own oil from Western energy companies, the oil and gas fields of the Middle East became a focus for coup d'√É¬©tats and military conflict.\nCome the 70s, this is why the stakes were so high.\nPlagued by the energy crises rooted in the Middle East, it became a race against time to find alternative supplies in the shallow, but turbulent waters of the North Sea.\nThrough the development of deep sea drilling technology, once inaccessible and unviable oil reserves suddenly became viable.\nIt was the moment when Western Europe and the US finally unshackled themselves from their 20th century energy security nightmare.\nIn 2015, the North Sea oil industry will be 50 years old.\nThe truth is, our backyard has now become what the industry calls 'mature'.\nA lot of the infrastructure out there has reached the end of its working life.\nMany of the oil fields are on the decline. But while the former energy goldmine is fast becoming a fossil fuel graveyard, Britain is now poised to take the lead in developing the decommissioning technologies and facilities for dismantling and disposing of the ageing pipes and platforms that once supplied our energy golden age.\nWhile decommissioning lacks the glamour of the booming 80s, Britain also leads the way in enhanced oil recovery technology or EOR for short.\nEOR basically means sucking Planet Oil dry.\nThe age of what we call 'easy' oil is over.\nThe age of discovering vast new reserves like the North Sea has passed, so we're now left with oil that's more difficult - and expensive - to extract from existing reserves.\nAnd that's because as wells age, they fill with water rather than oil, so extracting the remaining oil starts getting very complicated.\nIn the eyes of many in the industry, the North Sea is one of the test beds - a proving ground - for these new super-smart ways of draining the bottom of Nature's barrel.\nWith new technology extending the life of conventional wells, and \"unconventional\" alternative fuels like shale gas and oil being extracted in many parts of the world, it seems the Hydrocarbon Age will extend well into the 21st Century.\nBut the dilemma we face is that while there are plenty of fossil fuels left in the ground, can we really afford to burn what's left?\nIt is pretty clear to anyone that looks at the science that much of the remaining oil and gas reserves have to stay right where they are, if we're to avert the runaway effects of dangerous climate change.\nAs the latest report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes clear, an important tool in our carbon emissions reduction strategy must include the capture of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and their permanent storage underground - Carbon Capture Storage (CCS).\nAnd this is where the North Sea might well play another vital and final role.\nThe idea is something deceptively simple.\nCarbon dioxide emissions from the UK's power stations would be captured, and existing pipes in the North Sea would be used to transport it to decommissioned and re-configured platforms, where the waste emissions would be pumped down into the empty reservoirs that once provided us with natural gas.\nThe big vision is that this technology can be applied in any country and across a number of industries and would eventually be rolled out across the world.\nCCS seems to offer us the chance to keep burning fossil fuels. But there are questions over its viability.\nSome fear that the stored carbon dioxide could leak, and others point out that implementing this on an industrial scale is possibly decades away.\nBut the fact that British energy companies are at the forefront of developing CCS technology, means that the extraordinary North Sea story is far from over.\nPlanet Oil will be shown on BBC Two Scotland at 21:00 on Tuesday 10 February.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

According to Tom Worville, a data scientist at football analysts Opta, the answer is a resounding yes.\nUsing an historical database built using information such as the build-up, distance, angle and placement of more than 250,000 shots, Opta can evaluate 'Expected Goals' - the quality of any chance a player has, and how likely it is to be saved.\nOr, in Bravo's case, whether it should have been...\nBased on the historic quality of those 57 shots on target against City, only 16 should have beaten Bravo, not 23.\nThe ¬£15.4m summer signing from Barcelona has conceded 6.7 goals more than he should have done, putting him in the bottom five of the 23 Premier League keepers to have faced more than 100 shots in 2016-17.\nIt gets worse for Bravo when Opta focus on his current eight-game run that has seen him concede 14 goals from 22 shots on target.\n\"Of those 22 shots, we get an 'Expected Goals' figure of 7.33 - so he has conceded nearly double than expected in that time,\" added Worville. \"It's a huge deficit, and the figures are pretty damning.\n\"I'm hesitant to jump to the conclusion that Bravo is a poor goalkeeper - we know that he isn't - but he's having a terrible time at the moment.\"\nMost keepers are having a better time right now, including all of Bravo's counterparts at other top-six clubs.\nIt is a 12-goal swing from Bravo's figures to those of Burnley's Tom Heaton, the Premier League's top performer by Opta's calculations.\nHeaton has saved almost five 'expected' goals this season - enough to give him the edge over the likes of Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Arsenal's Petr Cech, who average around three apiece.\nDavid de Gea has 'saved' one goal for Manchester United while Liverpool's Simon Mignolet has conceded one more than expected. All of them are doing much better than Bravo, though.\nFew City fans thought that allowing Joe Hart to leave for a season in Serie A was a good idea back in August. It is possible only Pep Guardiola thinks that is the case now.\nOver in Italy, Hart has had a positive effect to the Torino backline, despite conceding the same amount of goals and playing the same number of minutes as Bravo at City.\nBravo has delivered in one area for City, however, and it is the main reason they signed him in the first place.\nHis passing accuracy in his 18 Premier League games so far is 71.5%, ranked second only to Lloris. That might provide some solace to Guardiola, although even he would probably prefer it if his keeper started making some saves.\n\"Considering Joe Hart has conceded about one goal fewer than expected, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that with him between the sticks, City may have conceded fewer this season,\" Worville explained.\n\"Hart's playing behind a different defence though, which definitely has an impact on the quality of shots that he's facing.\n\"Additionally there's a lot more to goalkeeping than making stops, with the distribution side of things being one of the main reasons Bravo was bought back in the summer.\n\"Having Hart in the team may have lead to fewer goals conceded, but at the same time it may have impacted the style of play Pep wanted to implement.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The programme, coming a decade after the original Planet Earth was broadcast, has been, by all accounts, a truly extraordinary series.\nRatings show the series has been watched by all age groups, with surprisingly large numbers of young people tuning in to watch the programme live every week.\nThe series has become Internet Movie Database's highest-rated television programme of all time.\nHere are just a few of the things we've learned from Planet Earth II.\n1. Flamingos don't get sunburned\nIn the Mountains episode, we saw flamingos become trapped in ice overnight, only to be freed when the sun finally came up. Later, we saw them gather together in a group to go on parade in a peculiar courtship ritual - providing BBC One with some excellent new idents in the process.\n2. Sloths like to swim (especially if there is a pretty sloth waiting at the other side of the lake)\nSadly the female sloth being pursued in the Islands episode already had a baby and therefore wouldn't be mating again for another six months - but full marks for effort to this enthusiastic chap.\n3. Sir David Attenborough can present from a hot air balloon at the age of 90\nThe prospect of going to a freezing cold climate, climbing into a hot air balloon and trying not to shiver too much as a camera is pointed at you would be daunting for most of us. But not, apparently, for Sir David, who is still able to do this with ease despite being in his 10th decade.\n4. Watching iguanas being pursued by snakes is more exciting than any James Bond car chase we've ever seen\nWatching animals chase other animals in this series can be a confusing experience - do you root for the animal being pursued, because you don't want them to die, or the predator giving chase, because you don't want them to starve? Either way - there's no denying such encounters are extremely exhilarating (and traumatising).\n5. Men are more attractive when they tidy up a bit\nThe Wilson's bird-of-paradise in the Jungles episode set an example to us all. The brightly-coloured bird tidied up all the leaves from one patch of the forest floor so his bright feathers would stand out more and attract a mate. Far be it from us to suggest that humans could learn from this, of course.\n6. Baloo and The Jungle Book were fairly accurate depictions of bear scratching behaviour\nYou're a bear. You've got an itchy back. What do you do? Make extremely creative use of the trees around you, of course - proving in the process that The Jungle Book was more than just a children's film, it was a documentary.\n7. A giraffe can win in a battle with a lion\nBecause prey is so thin on the ground, desert lions hunt whichever animals they come across. As giraffes are relatively common here they are an important prey species. But one particular giraffe in the Deserts episode gave a lioness a run for her money, not quite outrunning her but managing to kick her away when she attacked.\n8. Bears like to vandalise video equipment\nThe production crew behind Planet Earth II learned one expensive lesson in the Grasslands episode. You can take recording equipment to the other side of the world. You can cover it in a grass camouflage. But the bottom line? Bears still like to smash up video cameras.\n9. Don't leave any food unattended in Jaipur, India\nAs seen in the concluding Cities episode, one particular breed of monkey, the rhesus macaque, has become adept at navigating the people, traffic and market stalls of Jaipur in India. Their brazen \"daylight robbery\", as Sir David puts it, of any food or drink lying around would put Aladdin's sidekick Abu to shame.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"text": "But it's classed as a chemical weapon internationally and is banned for use in war.\nFor this reason critics have questioned its use on the streets and say it can be lethal.\nPolice see it as safer than using force and live rounds.\nIt's not actually a gas. It's a liquid at room temperature and is mixed with other substances to form an aerosol.\nWhen it's fired, solid particles are dispersed into the air with the appearance of a smoke cloud.\nIt works by irritating the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs - basically, the bits of your body that are responsible for absorption and secretion.\nThere are many different types of tear gas. The most common form is CS gas or to use its full name, o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile. The CS is taken from the initials of the inventors Corson and Staughton.\nIt is usually fired in a canister to disperse crowds and large gatherings of people, perceived as a threat.\nTypical symptoms begin about 30 seconds after exposure.\nYou can get a watery, burning sensation in the eyes, breathing difficulties, chest pain, skin irritation and temporary blindness.\nProfessor Alastair Hay, who studies the impact of chemical weapons at the University of Leeds, says that while it is considered a safer option, deaths can sometimes occur. This is often as a result of people being restrained by police where breathing is restricted or when they are subsequently unable to breathe fresh air.\nPhysical exertions such as running and repeated exposure to tear gas can make the symptoms worse.\nThe effects can be even more damaging if a person has asthma or other respiratory issues already.\nPeople have also been known to be injured by the metal canisters used to fire the gas into a crowd.\nThe most commonly used remedy is pouring milk over the face.\nThe symptoms usually disappear by themselves after about 30 minutes. Fresh air and steady breathing help reduce the impact of the gas.\nBlowing your nose, coughing and spitting are also thought to help.\nRubbing your eyes can make the symptoms much worse.\nThe chemicals will stay on skin and in clothes, so taking a lukewarm shower and washing the clothes will help prevent any long-term effects.\nIt is prohibited to use any form of tear gas in war under the Chemical Weapons Convention as it is classified as a chemical weapon. However law enforcement teams around the world use it on civilians.\nPolice in the UK are regularly trained in the use of CS spray. They are told they can deploy it only \"when they feel that the offender poses a risk to themselves and/or the police officers and others in the vicinity.\"\nIt is illegal to buy or possess CS gas in the UK, but it is available as a form of self-defence in many other countries including the United States and some European nations.\nBeing in possession of it in the UK is punishable with a minimum of six months in jail to a maximum of 10 years.\nYou can, however, buy \"deterrent\" sprays which look like CS gas but contain other chemicals such as smart water (a non-hazardous liquid with a long lasting \"fingerprint\") or a smelling agent which stays on a person's skin, allowing them to be easily identified.\nProtest groups and websites offer advice on the best ways to avoid the symptoms of tear gas.\nThey say gas masks are the best prevention, swimming goggles and cycling masks are a substitute.\nProtesters sometimes use bandanas soaked in vinegar and water which are tied tightly around the face as a last resort. This also helps to prevent people being recognised.\nWearing contact lenses may trap the chemicals and cause more irritation to the eyes.\nTear gas was widely used in the trenches of World War One along with mustard gas and other more deadly gasses.\nA total of 87 countries signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 which banned the use of any chemical weapons in warfare.\nThe Foreign Office said it was looking at whether it needed to block the export of tear gas to other countries after Hong Kong's authorities used it on pro-democracy protesters as recently as September.\nFrench police recently used CS gas on Everton supporters who clashed with rival supporters ahead of their Europa League tie.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

After the second incident, he was connected to Thames Valley and then Bedfordshire Police.\nDespite assurances from all three forces that help was on the way, he said no-one arrived.\nMr Stockdale, who runs a dashcam company, followed the lorry to a depot in Dunstable where an ambulance took him to hospital with neck and shoulder pain.\nBedfordshire Police had called the paramedics and one of its officers arrived at the hospital nearly three hours after the first call was made.\nFootage shows Mr Stockdale stayed in the middle lane for some time, which motorists can be fined for, but he said he was about to move over when the lorry driver began to \"intimidate\" him.\nThe Northamptonshire force said it could not attend because officers trained to deal with such incidents were in pursuit of a stolen car. The force has seen the footage and an investigation is under way but no arrests have been made yet, a spokesman confirmed.\nSupt Dennis Murray, who is in charge of the force's control room, said: \"What we should have done was contact the other forces... that's a failure on our part, for which I apologise to the driver of that vehicle.\"\nThe lorry driver, who lives in Bedfordshire, was employed by Wincanton hauliers through an agency.

But he doesn't fit the stereotype of a brash property developer.  He is aware of the tensions development can create.\n\"Gentrification has to be seen from two angles,\" he says.\n\"Of course, the first is that of the tenant.\n\"In Berlin, when the prices rise, people feel insecure.\n\"On the other hand, gentrification also means change and progress.\n\"And even if it's unpleasant for some, it remains very important for the city that investment comes in.\"\nIn many ways, Berlin is still a city of two halves.\nOn the one hand, there is an incredibly fast-growing community of hi-tech start-ups.\nOn the other, the city's unemployment rate is more than 10%, compared with just 6% for the rest of Germany.\nMichael Plaumann lives in a homeless shelter in Neukoelln, an area earmarked by developers as the next property hotspot.\nTo supplement his unemployment benefit, he sells a homeless newspaper on the trains of Berlin.\n\"It's very difficult for me to find my own apartment for myself,\" he says.\n\"That's why I've been living in a shelter for a while already, because the apartments have become very expensive, and for as someone who receives benefits, it is just too expensive.\"\nThe $900 (√Ç¬£600) cost of his shelter accommodation is covered by his benefits.\nShould he find an apartment of this own, he'd be unable to claim the full rent because of a cap, which could price him out of his neighbourhood.\n\"I want to live in my neighbourhood. That's Neukoelln. I've been there for 15 years,\" he says.\n\"What bothers me is that in Berlin, more and more neighbourhoods are becoming ghettos. Berlin is not changing for the better.\"\nLisa Jaspers earns not much more than Mr Plaumann gets in benefits and wages. But she's happy.\nShe set up her own company two years ago, after quitting her well paid job in the development sector.\nHer business, Folkdays, is an online fair-trade fashion-and-accessories business, sourced from artisans around the world.\n\"We create designs that we knew that they can do,\" she says.\n\"And we actually sell our products online because it means we can actually offer our products for a price that is not crazy high.\"\nMs Jaspers also lives in Neukoelln, the same neighbourhood as Mr Plaumann, an area that typifies the gentrification of Berlin.\n\"I see pros and cons,\" she says.\n\"I have to say I'm pretty happy about the fact that so many people from all over the world want to live here.\"\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall brought freedom and inspired a cool and creative scene.\nLow rents encouraged a lively alternative music and nightclub scene, in many ways the foundation of modern Berlin.\nRoger Baptist, otherwise known as Rummelsnuff, worked as a bouncer for many years before he made music his full-time career.\nHe has over three million hits on YouTube, a record deal and a film in the pipeline. The 49-year-old lives on a former World War Two barracks.\n\"It's not Beverly Hills,\" he says as he gives me a tour.\nHe has an improvised recording studio, and the music he produces earns him just enough money to do what he wants.\n\"The danger for Berlin, especially inner-city Berlin, is that people move there and because it's a clubbing neighbourhood [they complain] it's too loud, they make reports to the police and the clubs have to close,\" he says.\n\"We need a loud inner city otherwise it gets boring.\"\nRummelsnuff is a mixture of Popeye meets electropunk - mainstream he is not.\nLike many musicians, he was drawn to Berlin for its energy, open attitude and affordable rents.\nDevelopment is necessary to fuel Berlin's economic growth - but the more there is, the danger is the less attractive it will become for the artists and creatives.\nThis cultural vibe has helped attract an influx of well-paid professionals from the rest of Germany and beyond.\nBigger companies are moving in, too.\nBerlin's research-and-development industry is growing so fast it's been dubbed Silicon Alley.\nJulia Leihener works as an \"ideation manager\" for Deutsche Telekom.\nShe and her team develop new technology ideas, from smart-home technology to the future of mobile phones.\nShe arrived here 15 years ago and still thinks it's a great city to work in, but she has concerns about the commercialisation of Berlin.\n\"It's good and bad if money's coming in,\" she says.\n\"Where I live, I really see how it's been polished up and brought me to the point where I moved because it gets too polished.\n\"There's a great tension building up, and I can feel that in my area.\"\nBerlin still has some way to go before it reaches the gentrified unaffordable capital many people predict it'll become.\nThe big challenge is how it continues to combine its creativity with capitalism, without losing what makes it so special.\nMr Ziegert believes his luxury development, Sapphire, represents the new Berlin.\n\"This is a great example of how [the] highest culture and highest art can at the same time be an interesting investment,\" he says.\n\"Simultaneously, Berlin is transforming and developing in a way that Berlin has waited for, for many, many years\n\"The challenge is to find the balance between the past and future, rich and poor, between art and functionality, and, for me, Daniel Libeskind is the architect that represents art in architecture and living art.\"\nAs for the penthouse?\n\"We're very excited about who is going to buy this in the end.

He was 38 and a father of two children.\nHe had suffered from mental health problems for many years.\nAn inquest heard that 24 hours before his death, Ian had been to three hospitals in two different health trusts.\nIan was first diagnosed with depression in 1998. He was deeply troubled and had problems with alcohol and drug addiction.\nHowever, his post-mortem showed no sign of substance abuse.\nHis parents said the establishment of a single trust to deal with people with psychiatric conditions could help other people in the future.\nThe couple believe a single system would help ensure that a patient's notes, capturing their full history, would be accessible to all medics, no matter where they showed up for help.\nCharles Hamilton said part of the problem for Ian was that he moved between health trusts.\n\"I think if they had a single mental health trust, where everything was collated together, all the information concerning the people presenting with mental health problems would be there there at the push of a button,\" he said.\n\"That way, professionals can access the patient's history and there are no delays in getting that patient treatment.\"\nElma Hamilton said Ian's final hours were very distressing.\n\"He went to three hospitals in two trusts inside 24 hours, trying to get help, pleading with people trying to get his point across,\" she said.\n\"He was frustrated and hopeless - he just couldn't get the answers he needed. In one hospital, he was waiting 10 hours to see someone from a mental health team.\n\"In a different hospital, he self-harmed.

{"text": "\"Lets go and see the celery rig,\" says John Shropshire.\nI'm intrigued by the Mad Max-style vehicle I can see across the green fields. Green, that is, with celery. The smell of the stuff fills the air, crunches under foot, fills the view up to the horizon, from an ever-so-pastel, whiter shade of green to a green so deep it is almost black.\nBut I'll pause and do some explaining before we get to that celery rig.\nThis farm is in the Fens, one of the areas with one of the highest Leave votes in the country, though it's also not far from Cambridge, one of the highest Remain vote areas.\nMr Shropshire has a business to run, but he's spending too much time these days, he tells, me, trying to persuade people what Mrs May mustn't allow Brexit to mean.\nHis company is huge: G's Fresh has a turnover of √Ç¬£420m a year, employing 6,000 people worldwide. It owns farms growing lettuce in Spain, spring onions in Senegal, beetroot in the US and, here and in Poland, celery.\nHe employs 2,500 people from Eastern and Central Europe in the high season, and he doesn't think Brexit will change either his need, or the actual supply.\n\"Nobody wants the seasonal jobs - maybe they want the permanent jobs. Let's face it, it is higher status in Britain to be on the dole than to be a cleaner.\n\"It's a nice evening in these fields at the moment, but it can be raining, it can be very hot and after a day on the celery rig you don't need to work out in the gym. Five per cent unemployment is incredibly low. The reason we've got immigration is that we've created too many jobs.\"\nHe says that's not going to change: the government will find a solution.\n\"We've had access since long before we joined the EU to people from Eastern Europe. There was a seasonal agricultural workers scheme that was brought in in 1948. We need foreign workers to come.\"\nHe shows me where the workers live. \"It's not the Ritz,\" he says cheerfully.\nStefania is sitting by a small table, knees drawn up to her chin, looking rather elfin in front of the cluttered dorm room, narrow but not that long, with six bunk beds, and pots and pans on the shelves.\nShe says the work is not too hard and her English is getting better. But she's sad about the vote.\n\"Not so good, because it's not good for Romanian people. I think we will have to go home.\"\nEvelina from Bulgaria thinks there'll be another referendum: \"I hope they will make a list of those who want a second vote.\"\nAgnieszka from Poland shakes her head. \"I honestly don't think so, but I hope things work out. It's not fair, we don't want to go out.\"\nAngel from Bulgaria says: \"The consequences will be terrible, very big. I don't want to say economic catastrophe, but disaster anyway. People wanted immigrants out of the country, not the country out of Europe. They didn't know what they were voting for.\"\nJohn Shropshire seems unconcerned by this aspect of Brexit.\nHe pays the National Living Wage, but says British people shouldn't want this sort of work. Mrs May has promised them good jobs, and that is what they should get, he says. Productivity is the real problem now.\nAnd he's heard all the complaints before. So has his son, who runs the lettuce business in Murcia in Spain. His kids got into the local school, and Spanish children didn't. The Spanish didn't like it much.\nSo that's not what he's worried about. Nor does he mind if farm subsidies go. He tells me some farmers voted to leave because they thought weaker rivals would go under without the handouts. He can see that might be good for business. So that's not his worry either.\nHis concern is the single market. He had farms in Spain before it was introduced.\n\"Before, getting lorries and machinery back and forth between here and there was a total nightmare. Stacks of paperwork.\n\"In 1992 we embraced the single market - we had a proper bonfire of regulations.  We really need access to the single market. If we lose that efficiency we are going to hammer the economy.\n\"We potentially could lose a lot of efficiency which could cost the consumer very dearly.\"\nSenegal is not in the single market, I point out. \"Yes,\" he says, \"but it does have a deal with the EU.\"\nSo, let's go and see the celery rig.\nIt's a big, blocky vehicle, moving so slowly an energetic snail could keep up, creeping forward on tank-like caterpillar tracks.\nTo see what's going on underneath its metal sides, I crouch down amid the celery stalks. I catch glimpses of wellington boots, hands reaching down to grab bushy plants, and the flash of a old-fashioned butcher's knife reducing them to a uniform size.\nI get a better view clambering up the iron stairway to the second floor of this brute of a vehicle.\nThe 10 people below, having slashed the celery, put it on a conveyor belt which sucks it upstairs, and zips the trimmed veg along, thrusting it into a plastic bag, and then shunting it on so another group of men and women can quickly pack it into cardboard boxes.\nWhile my imagination has Mad Max riding this thing over dunes of vegetable matter, it is a rather efficient mobile factory.\nJohn says he'll be OK. \"Business will be all right.\" That's not his worry. If the consumer wants celery, they will pay what he will charge. But it could be higher.\nAnd while Britain is coming out of the European Union, he could always move there.\n\"We're a European business, so I think it is a shame we're coming out of Europe. But we are always optimistic. We'll find a way of producing it with the greatest efficiency.\n\"We will certainly stay here in the Fens. There is a market for food in this country.\"\nBut the farm run by his 23-year-old son Henry in Poland could expand.\n\"Originally when we went in, it was to grow crops to supply people in that part of Europe in the summer, the market we'd built up, supplying from Spain in the winter.\n\"Now if there were controls on labour that made it difficult, or anything that made it too difficult, one option would be to take these machines, the celery rigs all around us, to Poland and grow the product there.\"\nIf his workers have to head home, some of his business might join them.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The paper trail vanishes into a black hole, or rather a black market.\nEnvironmental niceties are not observed on the black market.\nBut the expense of putting anything in a landfill in the UK and the difficulty of dumping cars means even the vanished ones work their way back into the recycling system.\n\"It's hard to know exactly where those cars go,\" says Mr Ambrose. \"We know a tremendous number are broken up and the parts end up on eBay.\n\"Others are exported as whole cars or as spare parts. Parts of your car could end up in a vehicle in Nigeria. That's not a problem environmentally. It's still recycling.\n\"But the money involved in this kind of black market is often also involved in crime.\"\nSo one way or another almost 95% of Y264 TKP will be recycled. The UK is expected to hit the 95% car recycling target set by the European Union's end-of-life vehicle directive this year or next.\nWhich is why the plastic bits of Y264 TKP, like the cup-holders stuffed with my daughters' hair-ties, will not go to landfill.\nThe legislation has forced industry to come up with recycling solutions - at a cost.\nIan Hetherington, director general of the British Metals Recycling Association says: \"The capital expenditure to develop this kind of technology is very high indeed, and it is only profitable when you are producing very high quality plastics at the end of it.\"\nSo the American firm MBA Polymers invested $30m (¬£20m) to develop technology to recycle high grade plastics.\nIts joint venture with the UK's European Metal Recycling (EMR) in Worksop recycles 80,000 tonnes of plastic every year. The plastic pellets are then sold to manufacturers.\nThe alarming truth is the plastic trim of Y264 TKP, which the dog did such appalling things to on the way home from Scotland in 2008, could end up as part of a Nespresso coffee machine.\nBut plastic, like metal, is subject to market prices. It is the low oil price this time. Cheap oil makes \"virgin\" plastic cheaper, so while the law insists on recycling, the margins for the recycled stuff are squeezed.\nThen there is the fluff - the padding, the upholstery, and probably the shoe my son lost in 2007. Technically it is ASR, or automobile shredder residue. There is a good chance it will go to landfill.\nBut there is also a chance it may go through another innovation - a new energy-from-waste plant in Oldbury, in the West Midlands where Chinook Sciences and EMR will turn it into electricity to be sold into the grid.\nThe grubby left over bits of Y264 TKP will then power, say, my washing machine.\nFinally there's the metal - the easy bit, even if its value is small.\nY264 TKP, replete with my memories, will go into a crusher, something like the Red Giant made by the New York firm Hammel, or perhaps even the monstrous Hammel 1500DK  that will devour a car body in around 20 seconds.\nThe parts are then separated, using magnets and flotation tanks to divide materials according to their atomic weights.\nThis is the law of the scrap dealer: Separation creates value.\nThere are precious metals to be had: rhodium, palladium and platinum, and rare earth metals, once discarded, now picked clean from mirrors, batteries and catalytic converters.\nSome call it \"Urban Mining\".\nOne recycling expert described it thus: \"The iron ore miners take the stuff from below the ground, we just take it from above the ground.\"\nThe steel will probably go abroad for smelting. Scrap is best suited for electric arc-furnaces rather than blast furnaces, and the most convenient ones are in southern Europe. Turkey is the favoured destination.\nFrom there, the metamorphosed chassis of Y264 TKP, possibly still tainted with the last few grains of sand from a Norfolk beach holiday, is likely to end up as a small (but I like to think important) part of the frame of a middle eastern skyscraper.\nIan Hetherington adds a final suggestion: \"It may though actually go back to South Korea.\n\"It could even turn into another Hyundai.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

He was also stripped of those victories.\nAny decision on reducing the ban rests with Usada, which might mean Armstrong is left disappointed, but he is angry that his peers have not been compelled to talk to Circ.\n\"If I'm Brian Cookson, I would make it a deal point that you have to come in and talk,\" he said.\n\"So if Riis doesn't talk to you, or Vinokourov doesn't, there should be consequences. I don't know those to be examples, but I can imagine.\n\"If you don't come in to talk, you don't just get passed.\"\nWhen asked for a reaction, Riis's team Tinkoff-Saxo said he has never refused to meet Circ and it wanted to respect the confidentiality of the process, while the UCI said it would wait until Circ's report is finished before commenting.\nThe three-man panel is expected to complete its year-long investigation in the coming weeks, with the UCI publishing it by the end of February.\nWhile Armstrong is underwhelmed by Britain's takeover at the UCI, he is far more conciliatory to the British riders who have followed him as Tour champions, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, particularly in relation to the doping questions they have had to face in his wake.\n\"I'm sorry, and I completely agree that because of the timing of things, it is down to me,\" he said.\n\"[Usada's reasoned decision] comes out after the Tour in 2012, so it's logical that in 2013 there's going to be a lot of questions. Especially in a year when Chris Froome performs exceptionally.\n\"Look, Froome won the Tour in 2013, that's 14 years after 1999. If in 1999 I was asked questions about the 1985 winner of the Tour de France, I'd be like 'What are you talking about? Why are you asking me about the mid-80s?'\n\"But the story was so relevant to people. When this went down, people were left with the impression, in 2012, that I was hanging blood bags six months earlier. That's not the case.\n\"So I feel bad for those guys, they shouldn't have been put in that position.

{"text": "UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced that the Heathrow expansion had been chosen as the preferred option ahead of a rival bid by Gatwick.\nThe Scottish government formally backed the Heathrow bid earlier this month.\nIt came after the airport made a list of commitments to Scotland, including creating up to 16,000 jobs and investing √Ç¬£200m in the country.\nHeathrow also said it would help to develop new domestic routes to Scottish airports, and would investigate whether Prestwick Airport - which is owned by the Scottish government - could be used as a \"logistics hub\" for the new runway.\nResponding to Mr Grayling's announcement, Scotland's economy secretary Keith Brown said he looked forward to the UK government \"cracking on with this as soon as possible\", while stressing that environmental and planning restraints needed to be taken into account.\nMr Brown said: \"We announced our support for the third runway at Heathrow two weeks ago, so we are pleased that the UK government has the same view.\"\nHe predicted there would be \"a number of benefits for people in Scotland\" as a result of the decision, including \"around √Ç¬£200m of spend for companies in Scotland, and the establishment of a hub airport in Scotland to support for Heathrow as its undergoing its change in infrastructure\".\nAnd he added: \"Potentially we've seen the airports commission saying there could be around 16,000 jobs for Scotland, and obviously we want to see that followed through.\n\"Beyond that, increased connectedness between Scotland and the rest of the world will benefit our economy and our tourist industry.\"\nAGS Airports, which owns Glasgow and Aberdeen airports, also welcomed the announcement, which it said would play an important role in supporting the Scottish economy.\nBut the operators of Edinburgh Airport said ahead of the decision that they believed Gatwick \"offered the better deal for Scotland\" and described the Heathrow plan as \"undeliverable\" and potentially \"bad for passengers\".\nAnd both the Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats have criticised the announcement.\nThe plan to build a new runway at Heathrow - which is expected to cost more than √Ç¬£17bn - now faces a long consultation before it becomes reality, with MPs not voting on the proposals until 2017 or 2018, and the new runway not being opened until 2025 at the earliest.\nSeveral Conservative MPs oppose the proposals, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Education Secretary Justine Greening and former London Mayor candidate Zac Goldsmith, who has resigned as an MP in protest.\nThe opposition largely centres concerns about the noise and environmental impact of Heathrow expansion, with the decision expected to lead to further protests and legal challenges.\nSome 783 homes will have to be demolished for the third runway, according to the Airports Commission, including the entire community of Longford and much of Harmondsworth.\nThe new runway will also mean several other residential areas will fall under the Heathrow flight path for the first time.\nBut most airlines and business groups are in favour of expanding Heathrow - Britain's busiest airport - as it offers more direct connections than Gatwick and handles more freight.\nHeathrow is already operating at 98% capacity and Gatwick is expected to run out of space in the next few years, but the decision on how to increase air capacity in the south east of England had been hit by delays.\nA study last year, led by Sir Howard Davies, recommended a third runway at Heathrow but other options included a new runway at Gatwick or extending one of Heathrow's existing runways.\nAs he confirmed Heathrow as the government's preferred option, Mr Grayling said: \"A new runway at Heathrow will improve connectivity in the UK itself and crucially boost our connections with the rest of the world, supporting exports, trade and job opportunities.\n\"This isn't just a great deal for business, it's a great deal for passengers who will also benefit from access to more airlines, destinations and flights.\"\nAnd the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, insisted a new Heathrow runway would provide a \"major boost for the Scottish economy for decades to come\" by providing better air links for business, with the promise of greater competition \"pushing down on fares for everyone\".\nBusiness body the Scottish Chambers Commerce said it was pleased that a decision had been made, but called on the UK government to speed up the final process.\nChief executive Liz Cameron said: \"London's major airports are continuing to operate at or near capacity and the longer it takes before work starts on expansion, the further behind our competitor nations we will fall in terms of connectivity.\n\"Now more than ever, Scotland's businesses need to be connected to the world, as we look to secure trading links the world over and encourage more of our businesses to export, particularly our small and medium sized businesses.\"\nBut Scottish Greens MSP John Finnie criticised the UK's government's decision and the Scottish government's support for it.\nMr Finnie said: \"This will damage the UK's credibility on the global stage where there is firm agreement on the need to reduce climate emissions.\n\"What is perhaps a surprise is the Scottish government's support for today's decision, given that it does nothing to advance social justice. Wealthy frequent fliers will benefit, as they will from Scottish Ministers' desire to cut Air Passenger Duty.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats also criticised the Heathrow decision, arguing that any growth in capacity should be spread across the UK and not just focused in London.\nThe party's transport spokesman, Mike Rumbles, said: \"The SNP have utterly failed to square their backing for Heathrow with their climate change commitments and ambition to reduce environmentally damaging short-haul flights.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The band enjoyed several hit songs through the decade, the biggest of which was their cover version of Chip Taylor's Wild Thing which topped the US Billboard chart and made Rolling Stone magazine's greatest songs list.\nPresley's song Love Is All Around peaked at number five in the UK charts in 1967 but was a huge hit in 1994 when Wet Wet Wet covered it for the soundtrack to the Richard Curtis film Four Weddings And a Funeral, starring Hugh Grant.\nBorn in Andover, Hampshire, on 12 June 1941, Presley, went to Andover Secondary Modern School.\nWhen he first learned the guitar, Presley was inspired by skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues, folk, and roots influences - popularised in the UK by artists like Lonnie Donegan\nIn his 20s Presley began listening to blues bands from America, including Louisiana Red and Lightnin' Hopkins.\nPresley had been working as a brick-layer and said in a previous interview it took three months for him to be persuaded to start playing music with a colleague, Howard Ginger Mansfield.\nHis cohort was a lead guitarist and Presley in turn borrowed a bass, before being forced to drive down to London to buy his own equipment, when he was asked to return the instrument.\nTheir first manager owned a building company and helped them by borrowing a van to carry their equipment around.\nThe Troggs formed in 1964 and, in 1965, Presley, Chris Britton, Pete Staples and Ronnie Bond were signed by Larry Page, a budding record producer who got lucky with a new band called the Ravens, who he re-named The Kinks.\nAfter the success of The Kinks You Really Got Me, Page listened to a tape of the Troggs singing their own cover of the song and told them to come back a year later, which they dutifully did - to the day.\nLost Girl backed by The Yella In Me was released on CBS, and was regarded as a flop. According to Presley, it got a single play on Radio Luxembourg.\nAfter that, Page came across a demo of Chip Taylor's Wild Thing, which had already been unsuccessfully recorded by a band called the Wild Ones.\nAround the same time, Presley had begun writing his own songs. Speaking to Stuart Maconie on BBC Radio 2 in 2010, he said: \"I started writing on the building site when I was a brick-layer.

{"text": "The resignations of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, newly-appointed Prime Minister Khaled Bahah, and the entire cabinet were quickly followed by reports that the parliament had rejected their requests.\nGiven Yemen's mercurial political playing field, another new configuration could be just around the corner.\nThe tension from four days of fighting and negotiation between the rebels and Yemeni security forces seemed to have reached a resting point, with President Hadi and Houthi leaders reaching an agreement on Wednesday.\nThat agreement essentially saw Mr Hadi capitulate to rebels' demands in exchange for a ceasefire, release of a kidnapped presidential adviser, and the withdrawal of rebel forces from some key positions in Sanaa.\nYet a day later, the presidential adviser had not been released and rebels still surrounded the presidential palace and Mr Hadi's private residence.\nJudging from their mass resignation, Mr Hadi and his government decided that operating under the rebels' thumb was untenable and found little reason to believe the Houthis would ever fulfil their end of the bargain.\nEither they have given up entirely, or they are now playing their strongest card.\nThe Zaidi Shia movement, whose traditional stronghold is the northern province of Saada, led massive anti-government rallies over the summer and then suddenly infiltrated the capital with its heavily-armed militia and tribal supporters, taking de-facto control Sanaa by mid-September.\nThe government, political parties, and the Houthi movement signed the Peace and National Partnership Agreement (PNPA) on 21 September, but it has largely gone unimplemented.\nOver the past year, Houthi leaders rightly concluded that they can use military might to change the political map and balance of power in their favour.\nThe true extent of Houthi ambition is unclear; but the fact that they did not kick Mr Hadi out of the presidency or claim the premiership indicates they prefer to control from behind the scenes by placing their members in ministries and high-level government positions.\nThis allows them to consolidate power, but without being saddled with ultimate responsibility.\nBut the resignations of Mr Hadi and Mr Bahah now turn the table on their strategy.\nSadly, the rebels' tactics affirm the power of the gun over the power of persuasion, and it marks a massive setback for the democratic transition process that began in 2011 with a youth-led uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a new government, and a successful National Dialogue Conference that produced agreement on the country's most pressing problems.\nThe Houthis were included in the 10-month national dialogue process, and their representatives actually participated quite constructively in the working groups.\nBut they were ultimately unhappy with the agreement of a six-state federal system they perceived would erode their power and autonomy.\nSince they did not win that fight politically, Houthi fighters set out to change the facts on the ground.\nThey systematically pushed into new territory, aggressively picking fights with tribal militia, government forces, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants, and established some degree of control in at least nine of Yemen's 22 provinces.\nThe latest conflagration in Sanaa was prompted by the newly-drafted constitution, written by a 17-member committee including a Houthi representative, which established a framework for the federal system that the Houthis vehemently oppose.\nIn his widely-watched speech on Tuesday, the movement's leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi outlined his demands, including revision of the new constitution and full implementation of September's peace deal, and advised the president to \"stop delaying and being stubborn\".\nBut it is difficult to take Abdul Malik al-Houthi at face value since the Houthis themselves have not implemented the most critical component - withdrawal of their forces and demilitarisation.\nWaving the fig leaf is a rhetorical flourish, but his anti-corruption message certainly resonates and may gain supporters among average Yemenis.\nIf the president and his prime minister are convinced to return and survive politically, they will emerge a far weaker and less empowered duo.\nMr Hadi's inability to stem the Houthi aggression over the past five months had already eroded his quickly evaporating credibility and public support, but this latest action might just be the end of this charade.\nWhen the Houthis forced a change in government and prime minister last year, there was some hope that a competent technocrat like Mr Bahah - a massive improvement over his predecessor - would manage to provide some leadership and momentum for the new government to fulfil its promises.\nBut the internal tribal divisions, meddling by the former president, threats from AQAP, and the Saudi-Iranian proxy war have proved too much for Mr Hadi and Mr Bahah to handle.\nFor the United States and its allies, the recent events and ascendency of the Houthis are deeply troubling.\nThe fact that President Hadi can control or claim loyalty from very little of Yemen's military is indeed worrisome, and AQAP is already capitalizing on the distraction, chaos, and unaddressed grievances in tribal areas to wreak havoc and grow its ranks.\nSaudi Arabia has halted its financial support, refusing to bank-roll a country dominating by an Iranian-supported, Shia-affiliated group, and this could lead to an absolute economic collapse with salaries unpaid and currency scarce.\nPresident Hadi has been a loyal and consistent ally in the US counterterrorism campaign - far better than his predecessor - but he is now fighting for his very survival.\nIf the Houthis are now the real power brokers, the US will have few allies to rely on for security co-operation, fewer intelligence assets, and fierce resistance to US drone strikes on Yemeni soil.\nAt present, the Houthis are sailing high - riding on their alliance with Mr Saleh and his loyalists in the military and their alleged financial and ideological backing from Iran.\nPresident Hadi might be able to prompt a public outcry for his return, but that would be a far stretch for someone who lacks broad support.\nThis may not qualify technically as a coup, but the result may be the same, and the Houthis are unlikely to stop until they have full control, at least over the north of the country.\nAnd unless external events shift the course, or alliances erode, we should expect to see Houthis calling the shots for some time to come.\nDanya Greenfield is the deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Forming a government is a delicate business at the best of times and for Mr Macron it is delicate in ways previous presidents can only imagine.\nFirst there is the tension between the poetry of campaign and the prose of government. It was Mr Macron's promise of renewal and change that won him his place in the Elys√©e Palace.\nHe has promised fresh faces from outside politics, an overhaul of the established political system and a new kind morality in political life.\nHis En Marche! (English: On The Move) movement has the feel of a start-up, with the average age said to be around 30. But he is also going to need experience, particularly in areas such as security.\nAlexis Kohler, 43: Special adviser and likely to be Mr Macron's secretary general at the Elys√©e. Joined a shipping company after working as chief-of-staff for Mr Macron while in government\nBrigitte Trogneux, 64: President-elect's wife initially helped rewrite his speeches but is said to seek role as a \"bridge\" to the president\nIsma√´l Emelien, 29: Right-hand man and longtime friend, head of communications and strategic adviser, ex-colleague in economy ministry\nJean Pisani-Ferry, 65: Economics professor and government adviser, in charge of Macron economic programme and big ideas. Founded Brussels-based Bruegel think tank\nSophie Gagnant-Ferracci, 40: Head of campaign team. Highly experienced corporate lawyer and longstanding friend of president-elect through her husband, economist Marc Ferracci\nFran√ßois Bayrou, 65: Political heavyweight, head of centrist Democratic Movement party; his backing boosted Macron candidacy in February\n\"The young technocrats that surround Macron are impatient for their go,\" says Pierre Haski, former deputy editor at the left-wing newspaper Lib√©ration.\n\"They think the oldies have made a mess of things‚Ä¶ [but] Emmanuel Macron needs to find a balance between the traditional big beasts of the main parties and the newcomers.  It can't just be the younger generation.\"\nBalancing the expectations of sweeping change with the demands of government will not be easy, especially as he is likely to face a politically diverse cabinet - and probably a divided parliament too.\nAnd that is the second challenge for Mr Macron: the unique blend of left and right that he promised in his campaign means that his cabinet will need to contain not just a mix of fresh faces and old hands, but a mix of figures from the established right and left.\nThere have been several high-profile figures from both sides who have backed him for president but until now his supporters have not had to sever their existing party memberships and some have already made it clear that voting for him as president is not the same as supporting his programme in government.\nBut lack of clarity has never left politics starved of speculation and since Mr Macron's hint on his pick for prime minister, there has been renewed interest in who might be given a position of power.\nA poll published on Friday suggested that the head of the IMF and former Economy Minister, Christine Lagarde, would be the most popular choice for prime minister.\nSome analysts believe she is a good option for Mr Macron because, while she has experience of ministerial office, she has never actually been elected and so may qualify as part of his political renewal.\nOther names that have cropped up include the current Defence Minister, Yves Le Drian. His appointment would be a \"reassuring gesture\", says Haski, and significant, given far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen's attacks on Macron as soft on terrorism.\nFurther names touted for senior positions include the centrist Fran√ßois Bayrou and the MEP Sylvie Goulard.\nBut this is all unprecedented territory, says Haski. \"We've never been through this before: a team created from scratch.\"\nEn Marche was only created a year before its leader was elected. And with no established party structure and no real campaign manager, responsibility was parcelled out to managers in different policy areas.\nThe only one who knows Mr Macron's mind, said one analyst, is probably his wife Brigitte Trogneux.\nMany say she is unlikely to be given a prominent political role, even though she has played a key part in her husband's campaign. Their relationship has been controversial - 24 years his senior, Brigitte met her future husband when she taught him drama at school - and Mr Macron has been stern about politicians employing family members.\nAs if this was not amorphous enough, in a month's time the new president-elect will face another round of elections - for the French parliament.  All 577 posts are up for election and En Marche! has vowed to run candidates in every seat.\nAn absolute majority would be a \"political miracle\", unexpected even by those close to Mr Macron such as mentor Alain Minc.\n\"They'll have to make a coalition,\" he told me. \"I don't believe at all that he's able to have 280 MPs coming from En Marche! with half of them beginning in politics and chosen from 14,000 CVs sent by email.\"\nThe result is that Emmanuel Macron may find governing very difficult. His experience as economy minister taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether En Marche! can form a stable coalition to stand a chance of getting its reforms passed.\nIn that sense, the coming days will be a time of frenetic activity for Team Macron, as high-profile figures from both the centre-right Republicans and the centre-left Socialist Party absorb the scale of his win and the future direction of political power in France.\nSome may leave their parties to join him - if there are enough of them, it could sign the death warrant for France's two main parties. But it is a fine balance for Mr Macron: he needs enough of them on board the boat to stabilise it, but too many and his political vision is sunk.

{"text": "Themicroscopic modelwas based on a 195-year-old design by the inventor Robert Stirling.\nChanges included the replacement of the original pistons with a laser beam.\nThe physicists said they were \"astonished\" by how efficiently the machine converted heat into power - but said it did \"not run smoothly\" and had no practical use in its current form.\nA conventional Stirling engine has a cylinder of gas attached to a heat source at one end and a cold source at the other.\nThe gas is alternately heated and cooled by being shifted to the different temperature locations.\nAs the gas is heated it expands, driving a piston outwards which drives a wheel. This causes a displacer - also attached to the wheel - to move in the cylinder, shifting the majority of the heated gas to the cool area where it contracts, drawing the piston back in.\nThis moves the displacer back to its original position shifting the gas back to the hot area, and the process repeats.\nA two cylinder variant of the engine uses two pistons rather than a displacer.\n\"We wanted to understand how such a basic principle works, and if it works at all at a micron-length scale,\" Prof Clemens Bechinger told the BBC.\n\"Nowadays everybody is trying to make things smaller - electronic circuits and mechanical devices get smaller and smaller - so we thought why not try to investigate this basic process at a micro-scale.\"\nThe physicists carried out their research at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems at the University of Stuttgart and published it in the latest edition of the Nature Physics Journal.\nTo adapt the engine down to micro-size, they replaced the cylinder of gas with a single micron-sized particle made of a plastic called melamine, roughly 10,000 times the size of an atom.\nThe particle was submerged in a chamber of water four-thousandths of a millimetre high.\nThe pistons were replaced with a focused infrared laser beam which acted as \"optical tweezers\", holding the particle in place.\nThe stronger the laser's intensity the more the particle was confined to one spot. The weaker the intensity the more the particle was able to fluctuate around that spot exploring a larger space.\nThe particle thus behaved in a similar way to the molecules in the original heat engine. When the particle was restricted in movement, it resembled the state the molecules would have been in when the gas was compressed. When it was able to move more freely it acted as the molecules would have done when the gas had been able to expand.\nSince it was impractical to recreate hot and cold heat baths at the micro-level, a second laser was used. It heated the mixture to 90C (194F) in less than 10 milliseconds. It then was allowed to rapidly cool back to room temperature as soon as the laser was turned off.\nAlthough this allowed the physicists to recreate the heat engine process, the amount of energy gained per cycle was not stable.\n\"In contrast to a macroscopic heat engine where everything works in a very smooth and very deterministic fashion, our engine stutters,\" said Prof Bechinger.\nHe said this was because the water molecules in the solution surrounding the microparticle were constantly colliding into it, causing energy to be passed back and forth.\nIn the larger engine the amount of energy generated by the engine dwarfed that of the tiny collisions happening inside the machine, making them irrelevant. But in the microscopic engine the energy levels were much more similar and could even bring the process to a standstill in extreme cases.\nAlthough this made the amount of energy produced per cycle irregular, the team said they were surprised that on average, across a range of cycles, the micro-machine was as efficient as its larger counterpart.\n\"That was something we did not expect when we started the project,\" said Prof Bechinger.\nAlthough the physicists conceded that a mini-steam engine would never be a practical power source, they said they hoped their research could now be used to create more stable power sources for micro-machines.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Until 13 March, he was Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires.\nAnalysts did not see him as a favourite for the job of succeeding Benedict XVI, and his advanced age - at 76, he is just two years younger than Benedict at the time of his election in 2005 - may have surprised those expecting a younger man as the 266th Pope.\nHowever he appeals to both Church conservatives and reformers, being seen as orthodox on sexual matters, for instance, but liberal on social justice - though far from being a \"liberation theologist\".\nHe was born on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, of Italian descent.\nAccording to his official Vatican biography, he was ordained as a Jesuit in 1969 and went on to study in Argentina and Germany.\nAs a young man he had a lung removed because of an infection, but his health is currently said to be good.\nHe became a bishop in 1992 and Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. At the 2005 conclave, he was seen as a contender for the papacy.\nHis election took many by surprise in his home city, where many had thought his age ruled him out, says the BBC's Marcia Carmo in Buenos Aires.\nBut any surprise soon gave way to the jubilant blaring of car horns on the streets.\nAs Cardinal Bergoglio, his sermons always had an impact in Argentina and he often stressed social inclusion, indirectly criticising governments that did not pay attention to those on the margins of society, our correspondent says.\nFrancesca Ambrogetti, who co-authored a biography of him, told Reuters news agency that part of his public appeal lay in his \"sober and austere\" humble lifestyle.\nIn Buenos Aires, he lived in a simple flat. When in Rome,  he often preferred to keep his black robe on and is also said to have re-used the cardinal's vest used by his predecessor.\nOn the morning after his election, BBC Rome correspondent David Willey reported, the new Pope slipped out of Vatican City in a motorcade of unmarked vehicles to pray in a Roman Basilica.\nOn the way back to the Vatican, he insisted on settling his bill at a hotel for clergy in the centre of the Italian capital, where he had been staying until the Conclave began on Monday.\nFor the Church establishment, it is a novelty to have a Jesuit in charge - members are supposed to avoid ecclesiastical honours and serve the Pope himself.\nAs a Jesuit, he is a member of perhaps the most powerful and experienced religious order of the Catholic Church, who are known as expert communicators, writes David Willey.\nIt appears that few who know him doubt his conservative credentials.\nThis is how Monsignor Osvaldo Musto, who was at seminary with him, described him in a BBC News article back in 2005: \"He's as uncompromising as Pope John Paul II, in terms of the principles of the Church - everything it has defended regarding euthanasia, the death penalty, abortion, the right to life, human rights, celibacy of priests.\"\nHis views have been put to the test in Argentina, the first Latin American country to legalise same-sex marriage with a President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who promotes free contraception and artificial insemination.\nWhen he argued that gay adoptions discriminated against children, the president said his tone harked back to \"medieval times and the Inquisition\".\nHowever she welcomed the election to the papacy of a fellow countryman, noting his choice of name appeared to be \"in reference to St Francis of Assisi, the saint of the poor\" and boded well for unifying \"all humans as equal, with fellowship, with love, with justice and equity\".\nAside from his universal significance, the former cardinal appears to be a strong Argentine patriot, telling Argentine veterans of the Falklands War at a Mass last year:  \"We come to pray for all who have fallen, sons of the Homeland who went out to defend their mother, the Homeland, and to reclaim what is theirs.\"\nOne subject of controversy is his role under the Argentine military dictatorship of 1976-1983, when he led the country's Jesuits.\nHe was accused of effectively delivering two fellow priests into the hands of the military authorities in 1976 by declining to publicly endorse their social work in the slums of Buenos Aires, which infuriated the junta at the time, the BBC's Vladimir Hernandez reports.\nAnother accusation levelled against him from the \"Dirty War\" era is that he failed to follow up a request to help find the baby of a woman kidnapped when five months' pregnant and killed in 1977. It is believed the baby was illegally adopted.\nThe Vatican strenuously denies Pope Francis was guilty of any wrongdoing under the Junta.\nIt has now emerged that in 2011 he took initial steps towards beatifying Argentine priests murdered under military rule.\nIn 1976, Franciscan priests Carlos de Dios Murias and Gabriel Longueville, who was French, were killed after confronting local leaders in the western province of La Rioja.\nCardinal Bergoglio approved the beatification cause for both priests and a lay church worker, who was also found dead days later.\n\"Bergoglio signed it and warned us to be discreet, saying that many Argentine bishops, especially older ones, were against causes based on social engagement,\" the head of the Franciscan order in Argentina and Uruguay, Carlos Trovarelli, told Italian newspaper La Stampa.\n\"Thanks to his caution, the process moved forward,\" he added.\nIn a separate case, he also put forward for sainthood five Catholic churchmen who were killed at the St Patrick church in Buenos Aires also in 1976.\nAdolfo Perez Esquivel, a human rights activist at the time who was jailed and tortured by the regime, told BBC News: \"There were some bishops who were in collusion with the military, but Bergoglio is not one of them.\"\nDuring Argentina's economic crisis of 2001, Cardinal Bergoglio protested at police brutality during the unrest which saw President Fernando de la Rua swept from power.\n\"We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least,\" he was quoted as saying by the National Catholic Reporter at a gathering of Latin American bishops in 2007.\nSince becoming pope, he has continued to put his concern about economic inequality at the forefront of his message.\nIn Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), the first major work he has written since he became Pope, he says \"the worship of the ancient golden calf... has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy\".\nThe document also suggests Pope Francis is planning radical reforms to the Vatican bureaucracy, another theme that has gained prominence in his papacy.\nHe has put together a team of eight cardinals from outside the Holy See's administration who will look at ways to reshape the bureaucracy.\nHe has also adopted a markedly less formal tone than his predecessor, underlining his reputation for simplicity and humility.\nWhile marking that the core of Catholic doctrine on sexuality is not up for negotiation, he has said the Church has been too focused on enforcing the rules for human behaviour.\nSpeaking to reporters in July, he responded to rumours of a \"gay lobby\" in the Vatican by denying its existence, but added: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\nAnd in an unprecedented move, he has ordered a survey to be conducted of lay Catholics' opinions on Church teachings on sexual ethics and family life.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

civil partnership but one who is in a same-sex marriage.\n\"In some ways we crossed the Rubicon last year when it was agreed that Kirk sessions could call someone in a civil partnership and for many

He may even discover that his style of play is better suited to Australian conditions.\nThe England selectors will have debated whether or not to allow him an extended spell in the team.\nMaybe he would have come through the experience a better player? But playing with the axe hanging over you is not helpful to recovering your best form.\nI felt in May of 2013 that if Alastair Cook and I had the opportunity to open together for the whole summer, we could have made a real go of the job.\nThe lack of backing I received was because of my poor performances against New Zealand, but I reckon if I could have been allowed to move through that challenging learning experience of my first real dip in form as an England player, I would have been better for it.\nAfter all, my partnership with Cook was a success in terms of the runs we put on together, and the team was winning matches and series.\nMoving through the difficult learning process of being a newcomer to Test cricket is not straightforward and, should a player receive the full support of selection when experiencing a dip in form, it offers a healthy return on the investment of your initial selection.\nVery few players experience a consistent graph of top performance in their first 15 Tests, but the best ones benefit from the exposure and learning over time. After all, South Africa's Jacques Kallis did not enjoy the best of starts to his Test career and look what happened to him.\nNow the focus of attention is on Mark Stoneman, who looks set to become England's oldest debutant this century when England face West Indies in the first Test at Edgbaston on Thursday.\nEngland's selectors have received much criticism for the number of players coming and going since the days of Geoff Miller when the panel embraced a 'consistency and continuity' policy.\nRather than blaming the selectors, it is ultimately down to players to be in charge of their own destiny and make the most of any chance that comes their way.\nIf anyone is looking for a scapegoat for England's recent problems at the top of the order, then I can recommend pointing the finger at me.\nIf I had taken my first chance with both hands in 2013 as Andrew Strauss' replacement, none of this revolving door of opening partners for Cook would have followed!\nI was given my debut ahead of Joe Root in India in 2012. But seeing him flourish as a world-class player who could become an all-time great, I am able to contrast our journeys and really appreciate his qualities, having lived through the challenge of trying to become a top-level batsman at the same time.\nI would like to offer my good wishes to Stoneman and others who have the chance to live out their childhood dreams by representing their country.\nAnd, of course, I wish their experience in the England team enables them to be more Joe Root than Nick Compton.\nSo here is my open letter to emerging England cricketers to help avoid the fear of being dropped:\nScoring big runs is the only currency which will keep the harsh spotlight away from impacting your game negatively.\nHowever good or bad you may be feeling about your game, you have to find a way to produce performance.\nDespite the well-intentioned advice from many good people in and around the England team, it is vital you make peace with the reality that as a player you are on your own.\nYou are a professional in your own right, and must retain belief in your own way of getting the job done.\nWhen I played for England, I was fortunate to receive kind support from greats such as David Gower, Mike Atherton and Geoffrey Boycott to name a few.\nBut when the time comes to go out to bat, no-one else can score your runs for you. As much as there are coaches there to help you prepare for Tests, they cannot know your game and your personality as well as you do. Trust yourself.\nRecognise that bowlers are top professionals too. They are also under the microscope and when conditions are in their favour, they can 'tighten up' too, which can ease the pressure on you.\nAlso, acknowledge that when you as a batsman fail, it does not necessarily mean you are not good enough for Test level - sometimes it is down to the skill of the bowler revealing his class. Even Sir Donald Bradman made low scores sometimes.\nVideo footage works both ways - for a batsman you can familiarise yourself with opposition bowlers as much as they may try to exploit flaws in your game too.\nToo much video can be counter-productive, and you can lose your 'feel' if you get too technical.\nAnd sometimes it is of more value to listen to the words rather than look at the pictures because some of the wisdom shared by former greats can be very helpful.\nFor example, some modern coaches may try to 'soft-soap' you to boost your confidence and convince you that you got an unplayable ball (when you didn't), but some of the sharper comments in the media may offer a more accurate analysis.\nStay focused on playing well. A resentment may develop in you should a former England cricketer have a pop at your technique (or character) in the media.\nInstead, just take it in the context of it being their job to do so - don't take it personally.

{"text": "The double world champion has the full approval and support of McLaren and engine partner Honda, who are having a difficult season in Formula 1.\nAlonso, 35, will race for the Honda-powered Andretti team on 28 May, and the car will be branded a McLaren.\nMcLaren are yet to decide who will replace him in Monaco that weekend, but Jenson Button is a possibility.\nThe 2009 world champion has retired from F1 but is contracted to McLaren as an ambassador. It is not known whether the Briton would want to come back to drive an uncompetitive car.\nAlonso said he had long held an ambition to win the so-called 'triple crown' of Monaco, the Indy 500 and Le Mans.\nOnly one man has won all three in his career - the late Graham Hill in the 1960s.\nAlonso, who won the Monaco Grand Prix in 2006 and 2007, said: \"It's a tough challenge, but I'm up for it.\n\"I don't know when I'm going to race at Le Mans, but one day I intend to. I'm only 35. I've got plenty of time for that.\"\nThe Spaniard added he would definitely race for McLaren for the rest of the season, dismissing speculation he could quit part way through the year because of the Honda F1 engine's poor performance.\n\"It's of course a regret that I won't be able to race at Monaco this year,\" he said. \"But Monaco will be the only 2017 grand prix I'll be missing, and I'll be back in the cockpit for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in early June.\n\"I've never raced an IndyCar car before, and neither have I ever driven on a super-speedway, but I'm confident I'll get to grips with it fast.\n\"I've watched a lot of IndyCar action on TV and online, and it's clear that great precision is required to race in close proximity with other cars on the far side of 220mph [354km/h].\"\nAlonso acknowledged he would be on \"a steep learning curve\".\nBut he added: \"I'll be flying to Indianapolis from Barcelona immediately after the Spanish Grand Prix, practising our McLaren-Honda-Andretti car at Indy from 15 May onwards, hopefully clocking up a large number of miles every day, and I know how good the Andretti Autosport guys are.\n\"I'll be proud to race with them, and I intend to mine their knowledge and expertise for as much information as I possibly can.\"\nMcLaren have supported Alonso's wishes because they recognise the efforts he has been putting in - and the frustration he is feeling - after three uncompetitive seasons since joining the team in 2015.\nMcLaren executive director Zak Brown said: \"Could Fernando win this year's Indy 500? Well, I wouldn't be so silly as to make any such rash prediction, but I expect him to be in the mix.\n\"Put it this way: the team he'll be racing for won the race last year, using the same Honda engine, and he's the best racing driver in the world. That's quite a compelling combination.\n\"He'll have his work cut out to acclimatise to running at super-speedway velocities, but ultimately it's quality that counts in all forms of motorsport, and Fernando is very definitely quality. He's ballsy and brave too.\"\nAlonso joined McLaren-Honda with the intention of winning a third world title, but the package has been uncompetitive, with the vast majority of the blame lying with the Honda engine. His best results have been three fifth places.\nHe has won 32 grands prix - sixth in the all-time list - but has not stood on top of the podium since the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix in a Ferrari.\nAlonso's contract runs out at the end of this season. McLaren want him to re-sign and there is a hope this will help persuade him to do so.\nThe unexpected development marks McLaren's return to the Indy 500 for the first time in 38 years. They won the race with their own car in 1974 and 1976.\nIndyCars is now a 'spec' formula, where all teams use the same car, though the different engine manufacturers are allowed to design their own aerodynamic bodykits.\nThe Indy 500 is the most prestigious race in the USA and the blue riband event of the IndyCar Series.\nThe unique practice schedule gives Alonso more than the usual amount of time to prepare for a race.\nThere is a full week of practice, six hours a day for five days, before the qualifying weekend on 20-21 May, and two more days of practice before the race on 28 May.\nThe Andretti team, run by former IndyCar and grand prix driver Michael Andretti, is one of the leading teams in the championship and won the event last year with American Alexander Rossi, who raced five times in F1 for the Manor team in 2015.\nAndretti raced for McLaren in F1 in 1993 as Ayrton Senna's team-mate, completing 13 races with one podium finish before being replaced by Finn Mika Hakkinen and returning to race in the US.\nAndretti said: \"Fernando's lack of experience on super-speedways is not of concern to me.\n\"I do believe that the Indianapolis 500 is one of the best places for a rookie to start because there is the opportunity for so much practice time on the track - and, as we have demonstrated, it can be won by a rookie.\n\"Fernando is a great talent and I have full confidence that he will represent very strongly for McLaren, Honda and Andretti Autosport.\"\nThis is a bold and exciting move by Alonso but one with plenty of risks.\nThe Spaniard remains in the very highest echelon of Formula 1 drivers and has more than enough talent to succeed in any car, but the type of racing he will encounter at Indianapolis is unlike anything he has yet experienced.\nIf he was racing on a road course - what Americans call F1-type tracks - he would be expected to be absolutely competitive straight away.\nBut Indianapolis is a so-called 'super-speedway' - an ultra-fast oval track where average lap speeds can exceed 230mph.\nNot only does Alonso have to get used to the intricacies of racing on a banked oval, including all the technical challenges involved, he will also have to learn the art of the 'draft' - using the slipstream of another car to gain speed - which is critical to oval racing.\nAnd because of the high speeds involved and the proximity of the cars, IndyCar racing has a reputation for being notably more dangerous than F1, and any accident can have serious consequences.\nBut what he is doing is not without precedent.\nHill, Jim Clark and Emerson Fittipaldi all won the F1 world title and the Indy 500, while Nigel Mansell switched to IndyCars in 1993 after failing to agree terms with Williams following his title success in 1992.\nAlonso will be able to count on advice not only from team owner Andretti, but also team-mate Takuma Sato, who raced in F1 in the mid-2000s.\nAnd former Indy 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya, who is also in this year's field, also raced against Alonso in F1 from 2001-2005.\nThis content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

That's just not right,\" he said.\n\"I've ordered an immediate investigation to look at the evidence and consider the views of employees, customers and the industry to see how we can deal with the abuse of tipping.\"\nAnalysis by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nRestaurants have the highest corporate mortality rate.\nThey pop up and disappear from our high streets with daffodil-like regularity. That's because consumer tastes can change rapidly but also because profit margins are often very low.\nAdd in high rents and staff costs in Britain's largest cities and restaurants will say they need to maximise every source of income to stay afloat.\nBut consumers tend to side with waiting staff when it comes to tips. They assume staff will see most, if not all of them - especially if customers have been asked to pay an 'optional' service charge of at least 10% on their bill.\nAdding tips to the existing code of practice among restaurants (which is voluntary anyway) may be the solution. But it may be tough to police.\nMost waiting staff are either young or foreign - meaning they don't know the law and don't wish to upset their employers.\nAs part of the investigation information and views from the hospitality industry and other key stakeholders will be sought.\nThis will help the government decide if ministers need to intervene to strengthen the voluntary code of practice.\nUfi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said the body \"would welcome dialogue with the business secretary on the matter of tipping and the industry code of conduct.\"\nMost chains use a \"tronc\" system, where all the tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, usually with around 70% going to the waiters, and the rest given to kitchen and other workers.\nThere is no law regarding how a tronc is divided, however.\nA spokesperson for Pizza Express said: \"To cover the administrative costs of ensuring that the tronc system is managed correctly and fairly, a small administrative fee of 8% is levied. Under no circumstances does Pizza Express generate additional profit through the tronc.\"\nMany high-street chains deduct fees from tips. These include: Ask (8%), Belgo (10%), Bella Italia (10%), Caf√É¬© Rouge (10%), Prezzo (10%), Strada (10%) and Zizzi (8%).\nRecently Giraffe has scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips, joining chains like Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's who do not deduct a fee.\nResearch from 2009 found that one in five restaurants did not pass tips to their staff, yet the vast majority of customers said they wanted waiting staff to receive the money left for them, the government said.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The proposed law, which will be subject to a bill in the next Parliament, will enshrine several of its measures into legislation.\nThe code's entitlement for victims to tell the sentencing judge and offender how a crime has impacted their life through a statement is among the measures that will become law.\nThe information service will include a helpline and website and aims to guide victims to support services.\nMinisters will also consult on plans to pay compensation up front to victims - many have had to wait years in the past - and courts will be modernised to include separate waiting areas for victims and defendants.\nPublicly-funded lawyers will also be required to have specialist training before working on serious sex offence cases.\nMr Grayling said the current legal system could be daunting for victims.\n\"Victims, especially the most vulnerable, can find it traumatic and difficult to know where to turn to for advice and support,\" he said.\n\"We are also making it easier for them to find whatever it is they need by establishing one simple source of information and help - be it tracking the progress of their case, applying for compensation, knowing what to expect in court, or understanding the range of support available to them.\"\nThe government is hoping to extend a pilot scheme in three Crown Courts that allows children to be cross-examined before trials, away from court, with their evidence filmed and later shown on video during a trial.\nConcerns had previously been raised about how children were affected by the court process - with reports of one victim who was cross-examined for 12 days by seven defence barristers.\nIf successful, the scheme will be apply to all child witnesses by the end of 2017 and may also be extended to include vulnerable adult witnesses.\nThe chief executive of the charity Victim Support, Mark Castle, said: \"Children and other vulnerable victims and witnesses should not have to face the trauma of giving evidence in a court building, unless they choose to.\"\nHe added: \"Our witness service team, who work behind the scenes in court, see every day just how distressing it can be... especially for victims of a violent or sexual crime.\n\"Putting victims' rights in law sends a clear message to police, prosecutors and the courts that addressing the needs of victims is central to their work - it cannot be an optional extra.\"\nVictims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove welcomed the plans but questioned how they would differ in practice from the existing victims' code.\n\"A new law cannot be used as a quick fix,\" she said.\n\"Recently, we've seen how the abuse of victims in Rotherham was covered up... I'd like to know how a victims' law would put a stop to this dismissive, ignorant and collusive behaviour.\"\nShe suggested the information service would not \"put an end to victims being pushed from stranger to stranger to find out what is happening to them. That's why I want to see the government going further by introducing... a victim care manager\".\nBBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says the announcement may be seen as an attempt to pre-empt Labour plans for a victims' law.\nShadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the party's taskforce had consulted widely over the past year.\nHe said the government had let down victims by cutting compensation for innocent victims of violent crime and leaving the position of victims' commissioner vacant for almost a year, before making the role part time.\nMr Khan said Downing Street had also wanted to reduce prison sentences by half if criminals entered a guilty plea, closed down rape centres and courts, and cut resources for Victim Support.\n\"This announcement looks like it's been cobbled together on the back of an envelope, in the dying months of this government,\" he added.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The US tennis player's announcement that she is 20 weeks pregnant means she won her record-breaking 23rd and most recent Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open while eight weeks into her pregnancy, at the age of 35.\nOn social media, the revelation has prompted both men and women to claim she is the GOAT - greatest of all time - and worthy of immense admiration.\nWomen queued up to express their comparatively shameful attempts at exercise. \"Sometimes I get a little winded when I try to just talk and walk at the same time,\" one tweet gasped.\nPregnancy alters woman's brain 'for at least two years'\nThe plain fact is that doing anything much during the early stages of pregnancy can be a challenge.\nGetting out of bed? Possibly. Making it to work? Maybe. Eating breakfast? Forget it.\nAnd that's because the female body is undergoing a massive physiological transformation.\nEven before any kind of bump is visible, hormones are surging and raging, causing dramatic changes in the way the body functions.\nDuring the early weeks, most women experience fatigue at some point caused by rising levels of hormones progesterone and oestrogen.\nThe advice is usually to rest - but clearly not in Serena's case.\nMany women also suffer from nausea or morning sickness, which doesn't conveniently end at midday, and a small number of women are affected very severely, needing hospital treatment.\nVomiting or retching is a daily hazard for the majority, sometimes before a test has even confirmed the pregnancy.\nBut even if Serena was lucky enough to sail through the first few weeks unscathed by nausea, she would still have had other physical changes to contend with.\nThese include the breasts becoming tender and swollen very early on, a need to go to the loo more often and sudden aversions to food and odours.\nDuring pregnancy, the amount of blood in the body increases, causing the kidneys to process extra fluid that ends up in the bladder.\nPregnancy hormones can also cause constipation and heartburn as the body gears up to cater for a growing foetus.\nAnd research shows that from the fifth week of pregnancy, Serena would have experienced substantial changes to the cardiovascular system, which delivers blood supply to the foetus.\nExercise is a good thing and is not dangerous for your baby, the NHS Choices website says, and it encourages women to keep active for as long as it's comfortable to do so.\nSerena's fitness levels and training regime may well have helped her through those early stages.\nHowever, a woman's brain undergoes a bit of rewiring too.\nA recent study found that pregnancy reduces grey matter in some parts of the brain, helping women bond with their baby and prepare for the demands of motherhood.\nIn fact, the researchers said the scale of the brain changes during pregnancy were akin to those seen during adolescence.\nAnd that could explain why so many women experience mood swings during the early stages.\nSo Serena could have been forgiven for being more than a little distracted at the Australian Open, where - incidentally - she didn't drop a single set.\nBut of course she is not the first woman to compete at an elite level when pregnant.\nMarathon runners, including Paula Radcliffe, often continue running well into their pregnancies.\nThere have been examples of women competing in Olympic disciplines such as shooting, archery, curling and equestrianism who have all taken part while pregnant.\nProfessor Janice Rymer, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"For elite athletes, a tailored training and nutrition plan would normally be developed with a specialist team. High levels of exercise at around eight weeks gestation should not affect pregnancy for these athletes and those used to high levels of exercise.\n\"During the first few weeks of pregnancy these hormones may actually boost physical performance as a woman's natural production of steroids will increase slightly.\n\"There are many health benefits to keeping active during pregnancy including a reduction in fatigue, lower back pain, varicose veins, and swelling of the ankles.\"\nAnd yet Serena has clearly achieved something special because she is right at the top of her sport, winning more grand slam titles than other player in the Open era.\nIf she takes less than 12 months off following the birth of her baby in the autumn, she will be allowed to keep her current ranking - which moves from Number Two to Number One in the world on Monday.\nJob done.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "On Sunday, the home secretary said the intelligence services must be able to access relevant information.\nHer comments followed the discovery that Khalid Masood appeared to have used WhatsApp minutes before carrying out his killings.\nThere are doubts about whether that action was related to the atrocity.\nBBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw has highlighted that the police had declared that they believed Masood had acted alone on the day, and would not have done so unless they had accessed and read messages stored on his phone.\nEven so, the home secretary has summoned WhatsApp's owner, Facebook, and other technology companies to a meeting on Thursday to discuss ways to ensure that security officers get the data they need in the future.\nSeveral chat apps have adopted a technique called end-to-end encryption.\nThis digitally scrambles their messages' contents when it leaves a sender's device, and then reassembles it on the recipient's computer using a shared key.\nThe technology company running the service is not made privy to the key, so is unable to make sense of the conversation even though it passes through its computer servers.\nSome apps, including WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, Signal and Threema, use end-to-end encryption by default.\nOthers, such as Telegram, Line and Google's Allo, offer it as an option.\nIf end-to-end encryption is active, the technology company running the app is limited in what useful information it can remotely disclose.\nBut if a phone, tablet or PC is not passcode-protected - or if the authorities find a way to bypass the code - the physical device itself will provide access.\nNot necessarily.\nWhen someone sends or reads a message, they generate what's known as \"metadata\" - information about their interaction that is distinct from the chat's contents.\nThis can include:\nWhatsApp has shared such details with law enforcement officers in the past and has said it has been co-operating with authorities over last week's incident.\nIn addition, if Apple users subscribe to the company's iCloud Backup service, the firm may be able to recover messages copied to its servers for safe-keeping and it has co-operated with investigators in the past.\nIt is not exactly clear.\nThe Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, told the BBC that chat apps must not \"provide a secret place\" for terrorists to communicate, and that when a warrant had been issued, officers should be able to \"get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp\".\nOn Sky News, she later added that she supported end-to-end encryption as a cybersecurity measure, but said it was \"absurd to have a situation where you can have terrorists talking to each other on a formal platform... and it can't be accessed\".\nHow this would work in practice is uncertain.\nWhatsApp, for example, does not store messages on its servers after they have been delivered.\nSo, even if there was a way to retrospectively unencrypt the chats, it is unclear how this would work without significant changes to its systems.\nAt one point, there had been speculation that the Investigatory Powers Act - which came into effect last year - might ban chat app's use of end-to-end encryption outright.\nInstead, it stated that technology companies could be compelled to \"provide a technical capability\" to remove \"electronic protection\" within their products - which has been interpreted by some to mean app-makers might be compelled to secretly create backdoors or other security weaknesses to let messages be unscrambled.\nFiles leaked by rogue US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden and Wikileaks suggest that even the most closely guarded hacking secrets can be revealed.\nAnd even if the tech companies did not share the technical details of the backdoors with the authorities - instead limiting themselves to passing on unscrambled chats - the very fact vulnerabilities existed means someone else might sniff them out.\nAs a consequence, public trust in their software might be undermined.\n\"The encryption debate always rages after a terror incident, regardless of how effective backdoors would have been,\" said security consultant Troy Hunt.\n\"Even if, say, the UK was to ban encryption or mandate weaknesses be built into WhatsApp and iMessage, those with nefarious intent would simply obtain encryption products from other sources.\n\"These responses are kneejerk reactions by those who have little understanding of the efficacy and implications of what they're actually proposing.\"\nThe TechUK lobby group said other hacking powers and a move to make internet providers keep a record of their customers' internet habits - which were also outlined in the Investigatory Powers Act - meant counter-terrorism officers already had strong powers to tackle threats.\n\"From storing data on the cloud to online banking to identity verification, end-to-end encryption is essential for preventing data being accessed illegally in ways that can harm consumers, business and our national security,\" said its deputy chief executive, Antony Walker.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The team has made the most precise map of the \"oldest light\" in the cosmos.\nEarlier observations of this radiation had suggested the first generation of stars were bursting into life by about 420 million years after the Big Bang.\nPlanck's data indicates this great ignition was well established by some 560 million years after it all began.\n\"This difference of 140 million years might not seem that significant in the context of the 13.8-billion-year history of the cosmos, but proportionately it's actually a very big change in our understanding of how certain key events progressed at the earliest epochs,\" said Prof George Efstathiou, one of the leaders of the Planck Science Collaboration.\nThe assessment is based on studies of the \"afterglow\" of the Big Bang, the ancient light called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which still washes over the Earth today.\nThe European Space Agency's (Esa) Planck satellite mapped this \"fossil\" between 2009 and 2013.\nIt contains a wealth of information about early conditions in the Universe, and can even be used to work out its age, shape and do an inventory of its contents.\nScientists can also probe it for very subtle \"distortions\" that tell them about any interactions the CMB has had on its way to us.\nOne of these would have been imprinted when the infant cosmos underwent a major environmental change known as re-ionisation.\nIt is when the cooling neutral hydrogen gas that dominated the Universe in the aftermath of the Big Bang was then re-energised by the ignition of the first stars.\nThese hot giants would have burnt brilliant but brief lives, producing the very first heavy elements. But they would also have \"fried\" the neutral gas around them - ripping electrons off the hydrogen protons.\nAnd it is the passage of the CMB through this maze of electrons and protons that would have resulted in it picking up a subtle polarisation.\nThe Planck team has now analysed this polarisation in fine detail and determined it to have been generated at 560 million years after the Big Bang.\nThe American satellite WMAP, which operated in the 2000s, made the previous best estimate for the peak of re-ionisation at 420 million years.\nThe problem with that number was that it sat at odds with Hubble Space Telescope observations of the early Universe.\nHubble could not find stars and galaxies in sufficient numbers to deliver the scale of environmental change at the time when WMAP suggested it was occurring.\nPlanck's new timing \"effectively solves the conflict,\" commented Prof Richard McMahon from Cambridge University, UK.\n\"We had two groups of astronomers who were basically working on different sides of the problem. The Planck people came at it from the Big Bang side, while those of us who work on galaxies came at it from the 'now side'.\n\"It's like a bridge being built over a river. The two sides do now join where previously we had a gap,\" he told BBC News.\nThat gap had prompted scientists to invoke complicated scenarios to initiate re-ionisation, including the possibility that there might have been an even earlier population of giant stars or energetic black holes. Such solutions are no longer needed.\nNo-one knows the exact timing of the very first individual stars. All Planck does is tell us when large numbers of these stars had gathered into galaxies of sufficient strength to alter the cosmic environment.\nBy definition, this puts the ignition of the \"founding stars\" well before 560 million years after the Big Bang.  Quite how far back in time, though, is uncertain. Perhaps, it was as early as 200 million years.  It will be the job of the next generation of observatories like Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, to try to find the answer.\nThe new Planck result is contained in a raft of new papers just posted on the Esa website.\nThese papers accompany the latest data release from the satellite that can now be used by the wider scientific community, not just collaboration members.\nTwo years ago, the data dump largely concerned interpretations of the CMB based on its temperature profile. It is the CMB's polarisation features that take centre-stage this time.\nIt was hoped that Planck might find direct evidence in the CMB's polarisation for inflation - the super-rapid expansion of space thought to have occurred just fractions of a second after the Big Bang. This has not been possible. But all the Planck data - temperature and polarisation information - is consistent with that theory, and the precision measurements mean new, tighter constraints have been put on the likely scale of the inflation signal, which other experiments continue to chase.\nWhat is clear from the Planck investigation is that the simplest models for how the super-rapid expansion might have worked are probably no longer tenable, suggesting some exotic physics will eventually be needed to explain it.\n\"We're now being pushed into a parameter space we didn't expect to be in,\" said collaboration scientist Dr Andrew Jaffe from Imperial College, UK. \"That's OK. We like interesting physics; that's why we're physicists, so there's no problem with that. It's just we had this na√Øve expectation that the simplest answer would be right, and sometimes it just isn't.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

But viewers were shocked to later find out they filmed the scene apart and they were stuck together in post-production afterwards.\nAddressing the rumours surrounding her departure last year, Panjabi said: \"In terms of anything that happened on The Good Wife, I think it's only respectful for it to stay on The Good Wife.\n\"It was time for me, for many reasons, to unzip the boots and step into another show.\"\nFans of the hit '90s US sitcom the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air were delighted last week when a cast reunion picture was posted on Instagram by Alfonso Ribiero.\nBut one person who wasn't so happy was Janet Hubert, who played Aunt Viv in the first three series of the hit show.\nShe wrote on Facebook in response: \"There will never be a true reunion of the Fresh Prince. I have no interest in seeing any of these people on that kind of level.\" Ouch.\nThe actress was sacked and replaced in 1993 after a conflict over money and egos with the show's star Will Smith.\nSmith said later Hubert considered him the \"antichrist\" and \"a snotty-nosed punk\" and she wanted the comedy to be \"The Aunt Viv of Bel Air Show\".\nIn the years since, Hubert has been publicly vocal in her criticism of Smith and has also claimed he and Ribiero had \"destroyed\" her \"20-year career with untruths\".\nMore instalments of this feud may be yet to come.\nWith two divas working together it was possibly inevitable there would be some fireworks.\nSo Mariah Carey saying she didn't exactly enjoy her time as a judge on 2012's American Idol while working with Nicki Minaj may not be a total surprise.\n\"Ugh.

Parents of the abducted students have been left to rely on rumours as officials have said very little.\nIn the pouring rain, people marched to the National Assembly and delivered their message to the politicians themselves. The Senate President David Mark was there. He told the drenched crowd that the military must do everything within its means to rescue the students.\nMore rallies are due to be held over the next few days. Some here are determined that the plight of the missing school girls is not allowed to be ignored by the political elite - many of whom send their own children to schools overseas far from the vulnerable students of north east Nigeria.\nThe protest, labelled the \"million-woman march\", had been called by the Women for Peace and Justice organisation.\nMarch organiser Mercy Abang told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that the government should do whatever is necessary, even if it meant holding negotiations with the abductors, to make sure the girls returned home \"alive - not in body bags\".\nAnger has mounted in recent days over the abductions. Parents have criticised the government's search and rescue efforts and the number of missing girls has been disputed.\nNigeria's Interior Minister Abba Moro told BBC Focus on Africa that he understood the \"outpouring of emotions\", but the government could not divulge details of what it was doing to secure the release of the girls.\nIt had to act in a \"discreet\" way because the militants had threatened to kill the girls if \"certain steps\" were taken, he said.\nHe accused opposition parties of politicising the crisis and said they should work with the government rather than criticise it.\nAnother march organiser, Hadiza Bala Usman, told the BBC the women wanted to know why soldiers seemed so ill-equipped to find the girls.\nShe warned that the abductions would discourage parents from sending their daughters to school in an area where few girls are given an education.\nSaruta, a woman from Chibok, told the BBC's Newsday that the community was desperate for help.\n\"For how long are we going to wait for the government to help us?

{"text": "This comes after a public outcry following revelations in November that a neo-Nazi cell had apparently been able to go on a nationwide spree of racially motivated murders over several years, under the noses of the German intelligence services.\nThe group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007.\nYet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities.\nThe NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law.\nThe trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany.\nThe story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany.\nIt turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998.\nSo why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated.\nThe failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny.\nA parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies.\nWhen we spoke to Peter Altmaier, a senior official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, he admitted that mistakes had been made:\n\"You have to know Germany is a federal state, and competencies are shared and divided between federal and state levels... and because we have drawn the lessons from the Nazi dictatorship, we have very limited powers of police and security institutions.\n\"There have been hints and indications of right-wing extremism that were not taken seriously enough, and therefore we have put this very high on the political agenda.\"\nAnother question that now worries many Germans is just how big a threat the far right poses.\nHuman rights groups say more than 180 people have been killed in right-wing attacks in Germany over the last 20 years.\nNeo-Nazis have murdered more people in post-war Germany than any other single group, including Islamists and the far left. But this is not yet reflected in official data.\nCould it be that Germany's sensitivity to its history has made it want to play down modern-day right wing extremism?\n\"Martin\", a former neo-Nazi leader who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear of revenge attacks, was an active member of the far right for 11 years. He has now left the movement and encourages others to do so through an organisation called Exit.\nMartin told us the revelations about the Zwickau cell should have come as no surprise to the authorities:\n\"The militant scene has always said we need people who are willing and able and trained in case it comes to civil war, and neo-Nazi propaganda always talks about civil war. The scene is armed. It's military.\n\"Weapons training is carried out in secret. In the Arab world, for example, with freedom movements there. The right-wing scene sees itself as a freedom movement.\"\nThere is a growing collection of secretive far-right groups in Germany which call themselves the \"Free Forces\".\nIntelligence services say this is the fastest-spreading section of Germany's far-right movement.\nThey say the cliche of the neo-Nazi being a boot-wearing, young, unemployed male skinhead is out of date. Nowadays you cannot always tell who is a neo-Nazi and who is not.\nThe Free Forces are attracting a new crowd, including students and middle-class professionals. Germans speak of a new generation of Kravattennazis, literally \"Tie Nazis\", as opposed to the traditional Stiefelnazis, or \"Boot Nazis\".\nThey use modern forms of protest and are harnessing social media.\nTake The Immortals, for example - anti-globalisation, anti-capitalist and anti-democratic, they warn of the impending extinction of the German people and call for a Germany for the Germans.\nHard for the authorities to catch, they use text messaging to organise spontaneous night-time demonstrations across the country, especially in university towns.\nThe protesters wear black cloaks and white masks, reminiscent of the hacker-anarchists Anonymous, to hide their identity. After 15 minutes on the street, they are gone.\n\"The leadership is always trying to attract members of the so-called upper classes and students who, one day, can act as lawyers or doctors for the far right,\" Martin explained.\n\"It's all done very quietly, out of the public eye. You would never imagine that some of those people would support the movement and they may deny their affiliation in public, but they are very much part of the scene.\"\n\"You can't describe the far right as a fringe group any more. All parts of German society are found in it.\"\nBut what exactly do they want?\nFar-right activists are camera-shy. They say they are hounded by police and hemmed in by post-war German laws which make it illegal to question the Holocaust and demonstrate public appreciation of Nazi Germany, leading to a number of far-right groups being shut down and their members prosecuted.\nWe visited Berlin's best-known neo-Nazi pub, The Executioner, to see if we could tempt the punters there to talk.\nMost people in the dimly lit, windowless establishment eyed us with suspicion and distaste, but after a couple of \"Himla'' cocktails, Uwe Dreisch, the former head of a now-banned neo-Nazi group, sat down with us and said:\n\"Who are we? We are nationalists. We care deeply about our fatherland. We don't like the state that exists here right now in Germany. We want to rebuild our country for our citizens, the German people.\n\"We want to protect our culture, our country, our religion. In Britain, you're also proud of your country, but here I, as a German, am a second-class citizen. This is because we live with eternal war guilt here in Germany. Others get preferential treatment, not us Germans.\n\"Those outside here who say this pub is full of evil Nazis, how would they know? They're afraid to talk to us. They just try to ban us.\"\nWhat many lawmakers in Germany say they do not like is that the far right rejects the German constitution and the Federal German Republic.\nSupporters of the far right want a new order in Germany, but while they live under the current system, some are establishing what they call \"national liberated zones\", dotted across the country.\nThe most famous example is Jamel, a village in northern Germany which has been largely taken over by the far right.\nIn the middle of the village is a brightly painted Nazi-style mural in which a traditionally dressed German mother cradles her baby, surrounded by her other children.\nAlso painted there is a proclamation that Jamel is free, social and national.\nWe spoke to Udo Pastoers, number two in the NPD, the legal political wing of the far right, and the leader of the party's elected representatives in the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the area in which Jamel sits.\nMr Pastoers was keen to discuss the NPD's current campaign calling for more indigenous Germans to have children.\nHe showed me a campaign poster emblazoned with the phrase \"German children need our country. Stop the German people dying out\" in which two beautiful blonde parents frolic at a sandy water's edge with their blonde and beaming children.\nMr Pastoers said the birth-rate in Germany was far too low and that women should \"reproduce\" more, so that Germany could still deserve the name Germany.\n\"Imagine a country called Germany that is filled only with Africans, Arabs, Asians. Biology is our priority,\" he said.\nThe NPD does not do very well in the polls. Still, it has elected representatives in two of out of Germany's 16 regional parliaments.\nMr Pastoers told us the party was virtually gagged by the German authorities. If they really could speak openly, he said, a huge chunk of the German electorate would support them.\nThe NPD insists the stigma of being associated with the far right in modern Germany means that people who would like to vote for it do not dare to.\nIn an attempt to boost its numbers, the party is currently concentrating on social issues, taking advantage of widespread unease caused by the global economic crisis.\nThey and the wider far-right movement run youth centres and football clubs, and offer welfare advice and family outings for those short of cash.\nFormer neo-Nazi Martin, who spoke of close links between the NPD and extremist groups like the one he used to lead, said the party's social card was insincere.\n\"They can't win over all parts of society with anti-Semitic and Nazi rhetoric. The welfare debate touches most people these days, but it is fake.\n\"One well-known neo-Nazi activist said: 'We'll make sure to be where people are suffering most, where they are shouting for help... Eventually we'll have them where we want them.'''\nGermany's far right is a minority movement but one the country's authorities cannot afford to ignore.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The battle within Islam itself between Sunni and Shia, so evident in the wars of the Middle East, and the fight between extremist interpretations of Islam such as those of Islamic State and Muslims who wish to practice their religion in peace, is now being played out on the streets of Europe with potentially devastating consequences for social cohesion.\nThese latest shootings may be the work of \"lone wolves\" but their consequences will ripple across Europe and provoke much soul-searching about the failure of integration over the past decades.\nImmigrant communities are already being viewed with increasing suspicion in both France and Germany, with their significant Muslim populations, and even in the UK.\nFrance has the largest Muslim population in Europe, some five million or 7.5% of the population, compared with Germany's four million or 5% of the population, and the UK's three million, also 5% of the population.\nIn all three, mainstream political parties are being forced to confront popular discontent over levels of immigration and the apparent desire of some younger, often disaffected children or grandchildren of immigrant families not to conform to western, liberal lifestyles - including traditions of religious tolerance and free speech.\nIn the UK, that unease has largely played out on the public stage in a more peaceable manner, in the debate over \"British values\" and the recent Trojan horse schools affair.\nThe fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie over 20 years ago following the publication of The Satanic Verses, forcing him into hiding for several years, was perhaps the first time the issue impinged on British consciousness, though the attacks of 7/7 were a reminder that extremist violence could also hit the heart of the UK.\nHowever, France has already seen much more violence on its streets carried out in the name of religion over the past decades, although it has tried to write off most of its recent \"lone wolf\" attacks as the acts of mentally-unhinged individuals.\nBut some in its Jewish community have responded to increasing anti-Semitism and the killing of Jews in France and Belgium by Islamist extremists by emigrating to Israel and elsewhere.\nRecent physical attacks on synagogues and Jews in the suburbs of Paris, where Jews and Muslims often live side by side in poorer areas such as Sarcelles, only exacerbated fears that the violence in the name of religion that grips parts of Africa and the Middle East, and which so many flee to Europe to escape, has followed them here.\nGermany, too, has seen a rising surge of anti-Islam sentiment in its cities, with worries about young radicalised Muslims moving from a concern confined to far right and neo-Nazi parties into the mainstream, as seen in the recent popularity of the Pegida movement, which campaigns against the \"Islamisation\" of Europe.\nBoth political and religious leaders in Germany have spoken out against the movement, and counter-marches have been held, but Pegida's fears have brought thousands onto the streets.\nThe killings at Charlie Hebdo are a deeply unwelcome reminder to the west that for some, mainly young radicalised men, their fundamentalist interpretation of their religion matters enough to kill those who offend it.\nAs a result, across western Europe, liberally-minded societies are beginning to divide over how best to deal with radical Islamism and its impact on their countries, while governments agonise over the potential for a backlash against Muslims living in Europe.\nToday, mainstream Muslim organisations in the UK and France have unequivocally condemned the killings, saying that terrorism is an affront to Islam.\nBut the potential backlash, including support for far right parties and groups, may well hurt ordinary Muslims more than anyone else, leaving the authorities and religious leaders in western Europe wondering how to confront violence in the name of religion without victimizing minorities or being accused of 'Islamophobia'.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of ¬£27,000 at the age of 28, compared with ¬£28,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was ¬£21,000 for those born in the 1960s and ¬£15,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about ¬£27,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - ¬£53,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

{"text": "He stood on the touchline after the final whistle in Trnava to make sure his players acknowledged the away fans, and then applauded them himself, but the support's response to the final whistle was a damning verdict.\nThere was plenty of ire at Hampden on Saturday, too, when two points were discarded against Lithuania, and it is the weight of public opinion that will bear most heavily on the mind and status of the national team's manager.\nThe departures of his immediate predecessors - Craig Levein and George Burley - felt necessary, that's why the decisions were made. Strachan banked a significant amount of goodwill during the first half of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, but it has dwindled markedly since then.\nIn 29 days, Scotland travel to Wembley to face England, and during that time there will be reflection, calls for recrimination, and eventually an element of resolution.\nThe immediate reactions to the 3-0 defeat in Slovakia were emotional, but there is a growing body of evidence from Strachan's time in charge.\nSome of the noise ought to be dismissed. It is absurd to suggest that Strachan does not want to be in the job. He may have spent time after the failure to reach the Euro finals in France assessing his willingness to lead the squad for another campaign, but he wanted to carry on; he is a passionate Scot and a committed coach.\nHe cares for his players, which explains some of his exaggerated post-match comments. He no doubt described Chris Martin's display against Lithuania as \"outstanding\" because he had already made the decision to start Steven Fletcher against Slovakia and did not want the Fulham striker to be the scapegoat for Saturday's 1-1 draw - but supporters have grown weary of the deflection tactics.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe players remain committed to the manager, while some of his predecessors have struggled to hold squads together, but that is not always enough. It should also be acknowledged that a new manager would not suddenly find himself working with a different squad of more talented players.\nEven so, there are decisions that Strachan has consistently made that warrant scrutiny, not least because his position is now under question. If the Scotland support no longer believes in the manager, then it does not matter if he still believes in his work with the players.\nSince defeating the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park in November 2014, Scotland have played nine competitive matches and won only three of them - against Gibraltar, twice, and Malta. There have been defeats to Germany, Georgia and Slovakia, and damaging draws away to the Republic of Ireland and at home to Poland and Lithuania.\nUnder Strachan, Scotland have failed to deliver a defining victory over a leading side in their group, or when it was needed most. At the critical moment, there has been a collapse of will. In Dublin, in Tbilisi and in Trvana, Scotland have performed poorly, failing to assert themselves, to play with confidence or poise.\nWhen Strachan's side defeated Ireland at Celtic Park, the display merged conviction with spirit and aplomb. The players performed, they refused to buckle under the pressure. That was thought to be a reflection of the progress the manager was making, but instead it has turned out to be the high watermark.\nHe has not found that balance of endeavour, ability and heart when he has needed it again. That is why it is legitimate to wonder if another manager could. Scotland's results once told of Strachan having improved the team; they now tell of a side that is losing its way.\nThe first-half against Slovakia was encouraging, since Scotland passed the ball well and worked hard out of possession, but still the home side scored once and forced two important saves from David Marshall. Scotland lacked a cutting edge and any kind of defensive security. In the end, the three goals conceded in Trvana were all avoidable, and poorly defended. So it is legitimate to wonder, too, if new ideas might be needed.\nLosing to the second seeds in the group is hardly shocking, but the manner of it was disturbing - the team looked deflated and defeated by the second goal - while drawing with the fifth seeds Lithuania was alarming.\nIn the meantime, Slovenia have been over-performing, so already in Group F Scotland seem unable to climb above their status as third seeds.\nStrachan has been trying to evolve his team. Where he once relied on Steven Naismith, Shaun Maloney and James Morrison, it is now Oliver Burke, Matt Ritchie and Barry Bannan. Change has to happen, but not in every position it seems.\nThe centre-back pairing of Russell Martin and Grant Hanley is set in stone, even if Christophe Berra - also a centre-back with limitations - is playing at the same level in the English Championship (when Hanley is not even in the Newcastle side at the moment).\nUp front, the conundrum has been what to do with Leigh Griffiths, and Strachan can no doubt make a compelling case for the worth of Fletcher and Martin as players who hold up the ball and bring others into the game, but Griffiths scores goals. It is the challenge of the manager to find a way to play a striker like Griffiths, or like Ross McCormack, another regular goalscorer.\nStrachan has brought the likes of Andrew Robertson, Kieran Tierney and Callum Paterson into the national team, but currently the side has lost its ability to be better than the sum of its parts.\nThat has been the puzzle for Strachan to solve; the answer may now be beyond him.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The latest has seen the Bolton footballer labelled the \"miracle man\".\nThe 23-year-old collapsed on the pitch during the FA Cup tie against Tottenham at 18:13 GMT on Saturday, but it was not until 19:31 that his heart started working again.\nHe was - according to Bolton's club doctor - \"in effect dead\" during that 78 minutes.\nBut how is this possible?\nThe full details of what happened to him have yet to emerge.\nBut the most likely explanation - and one suggested by those involved in his care - is that while his heart stopped working, it retained some form of life.\nThe cardiac arrest he suffered meant his heart was not contracting and therefore pumping blood around his body.\nHowever, even when this happens, some electrical activity can still be taking place within the heart.\nIf this was the case, one of several things could have been happening.\nThe heart could have developed a severely abnormal rhythm, known as either ventricular fibrillation - where it shakes like a jelly - or ventricular tachycardia - where it is out of control.\nThe third explanation is that it has developed pulse-less electrical activity whereby there is an organised rhythm but no heart contractions.\nIn some cases, the state of the activity can interchange between the three.\nThe important thing in such cases is to start CPR quickly.\nThis artificially pumps the blood round the body, buying medics time to work out how to get the heart working properly.\nFabrice Muamba may still be in intensive care, but nonetheless not everyone is as lucky as him.\nAbout 100,000 people a year in the UK die after having a sudden cardiac arrest.\nMany of those will have collapsed in places where help is not to hand.\nIt is why in recent years a campaign has been under way to place more defibrillators in community settings.\nHundreds have already been placed in train stations, shopping malls and, of course, football grounds.\nBut there are still not enough, according to the Arrhythmia Alliance.\nTruddie Lobban, the charity's founder, says: \"The problem is that it is still very patchy. There are more than there used to be, but I would like to see them as common as fire extinguishers.\n\"We need them in schools, outside churches and on every high street.\n\"You don't have to be an expert to use them. They are automated and explain to the user how they work.\n\"They can make the difference between life and death.\"\nEvery minute delay in starting CPR reduces the chances of survival by 10%.\nIn this respect, the 23-year-old was lucky.\nPitch-side at White Hart Lane were a team of fully-trained and equipped medics.\nWhat is more, a cardiologist was in the crowd and was soon by Muamba's side lending help.\nIt meant he received almost immediate attention.\nBut CPR alone is not enough. That only gives someone suffering a cardiac arrest a 5% chance of survival.\nWhile he lay stricken on the pitch, the footballer was given oxygen and three shocks using a defibrillator.\nThe aim of that is to try to get the heart working again.\nHe was soon transferred to a waiting ambulance and rushed off to hospital.\nIn total he received another 12 shocks before his heart started working properly.\nBut was he really dead?\nClearly not in the technical sense - although his life was obviously in the balance.\nSome people flatline following a cardiac arrest, which means they do not have any activity in the heart.\nThese cases are very hard to resuscitate people from.\nBut, instead, with some signs of a rhythm medics kept persisting.\nIn fact, experts say that even doing this for as long as they did for Muamba is not that unusual.\nCathy Ross, of the British Heart Foundation, explains: \"Performing CPR early buys the time necessary.

And it is a clear signal to those who would abuse others that they cannot hide and their abusive history will be disclosed if it means protecting others.\n\"This has to be one part of a long term approach to supporting victims which ensures that their experiences and the long term effect of disclosure on the people who ask is measured. Working with our partners, we will continue to support people through the disclosure process and to prevent people becoming victims of this terrible crime.\"\nAny person can make an application about their partner if they are concerned they may harm them; and any concerned third party (such as a parent, relative, neighbour or friend) can also make an application if they are concerned.\nHowever, a third party person making an application would not ordinarily receive information about the partner.

{"text": "The Gunners were extremely poor and were outplayed for long periods at home, but they still picked up a point and actually created enough chances to win the match because of the brilliance of Mesut Ozil.\nI would not even say Ozil had a particularly good game but he got his side out of jail with his cross for Kieran Gibbs' equaliser.\nOzil had already provided two balls from a free-kick and a corner that Olivier Giroud should have scored from - he hit the bar with his first header and sent the second one wide.\nTottenham knew how dangerous he was because they stopped him from getting on the ball in open play until the final 15 minutes, but his magic touch was still able to rescue Arsenal from what would have been a very bad defeat.\nOzil had already made 47 chances this season going into Sunday's game, the most in the Premier League alongside West Ham's Dimitri Payet. That works out at an average of almost five a game in each of his previous 10 appearances.\nIn the first half at Emirates Stadium, however, the German did not even have a sniff of creating an opening in open play.\nThat was because, from the off, Spurs had the perfect game plan. They identified Arsenal's best two players as Ozil and Alexis Sanchez and they stopped their supply at source, pressing high to stop the Gunners from building from the back.\nAny time Ozil, Sanchez or Santi Cazorla did get the ball, they had two or three men on them straight away and they took them completely out of the game. Ozil dropped deep to get the ball and could not do any damage from there.\nIt was only in the last 25 minutes that Ozil began to get any time in possession in the Tottenham half, and he made it count.\nI think he is at his most deadly when he picks up the ball when an initial attack has been cleared. The defence pushes up and Ozil is just waiting for them to do that so he can deliver it into the space they leave behind.\nI have seen it happen time and time again and it was a similar story on Sunday when he picked up the ball and spotted Gibbs's run to the far post.\nIt was his 10th assist of the campaign, four more than anyone else, and he set a Premier League record for making a goal in six successive games in the same season.\nSome people still seem to have the perception that Ozil is lazy, or a luxury player, so it is worth highlighting again how hard he actually works.\nHe does more work for the Arsenal team than any other midfielder or forward bar Aaron Ramsey and covers a lot of ground right across the pitch.\nI think it is easy to get the wrong idea because of his style on the ball. Someone like Alexis Sanchez looks busier because he does a lot of one-twos and plays with more urgency.\nIt is great to play it quick and early, either one-touch or two-touch like Sanchez often does, but there is nothing wrong with being different.\nOzil has the imagination to hold on to it a little bit longer because he knows the picture will change if the defence are anticipating a one-two or an early ball, and that might leave him some space.\nSo he is not lazy, either off the ball or on it. Even if he was, what he brings to the team means his team-mates would not mind.\nWhen I was in Tottenham's midfield with Rafael van der Vaart, or a few years earlier when we had Dimitar Berbatov up front, I was prepared to work harder just to get the ball to them - Rafa would create a lot of chances every game and Berba would stick a lot away.\nIt was not just me. The whole team were prepared to do more work than them because, collectively, we knew those players were going to win us games.\nThe really brilliant thing about Spurs for most of the match was that they did not allow him into the game, and it was one of the reasons Arsenal found it so difficult to get going.\nI played in 11 north London derbies for Spurs and I would have been devastated walking off the Emirates pitch with only a point on Sunday.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTottenham completely dominated, but Arsenal were always going to get at least one chance. I always felt Spurs would need that second goal, and so it proved.\nIt was so close to being a complete performance from Mauricio Pochettino's side - in terms of their pressing, their aggression and their creativity it was absolutely spot on.\nThe only thing they were lacking was a killer instinct when they were 1-0 up and creating further chances. They need to be able to put those kinds of games to bed when they have bossed them.\nPochettino will be hugely disappointed to only draw the game but it was still a massive statement of intent by his team.\nEveryone at the club will want to stay under the radar so they probably will not appreciate me saying this on Match of the Day 2, but I am certain they will finish in the top four this season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nA lot of that is down to Pochettino's training methods and his willingness to use young players. It means they have got energy and pace all over the pitch. They look as fit and strong as any team I have seen this season.\nDefensively they look solid - the only worry they had earlier in the season was over Harry Kane's form, but now he is banging in the goals again.\nSpurs have been getting better every week and it looks to me like they are close to the peak of their powers.

{"text": "Her name features in everyday transactions in every town and city whenever a person goes to a cash dispenser, buys bread at a shop, pays a restaurant bill or a cab driver.\nBut only those who carefully study the banknotes will realise who Ms Gumataotao Rios is.\nThis Californian woman of Mexican descent has been treasurer of the United States since 2009.\nSince then, her signature has been printed on some 27 billion dollar notes.\n\"Currency and coins are the way we touch the American public every day,\" she tells BBC Mundo in her Washington DC office, just a few steps from the White House.\n\"We are part of history.\"\nWomen have left their mark on that history in a very special way, because they have held the position of US treasurer since 1949. Six of the past 10 treasurers have also been of Hispanic descent.\nMs Gumataotao Rios says that the first woman treasurer, Georgia Neese Clark, was appointed just after the Second World War, when women's participation in the workforce increased considerably.\n\"It was just very courageous and probably very symbolic for President Harry S Truman to make that appointment,\" she says.\nSince then, every US president has chosen a woman's signature to appear alongside that of the US secretary of treasury on one of the most popular currencies in the world.\nMs Gumataotao Rios explains that having women treasurers is not something that is institutionalised or has been done in order to fill a quota.\n\"They look at the individuals more than anything,\" she says. \"Clark, for instance, was a banker.\"\nShe also rejects the notion that her Hispanic heritage might influence her daily activities: \"Of course I am very proud to be Mexican-American, but in my role today I am an administration official.\"\nThe treasurer believes that her own previous experience in areas such as economic development, real estate and investments made her a good choice for the post at a time when the recent global financial crisis was at its height.\nShe also stresses that her work does not only consist of signing US banknotes, where her Mexican surname - Rios - appears next to her husband's Guamanian name, Gumataotao.\nAlthough Treasury Secretary Jack Lew makes the final financial decisions at the treasury department, Ms Gumataotao Rios supervises the nearly 4,000 employees who work at the US Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\nShe also oversees the gold reserves at Fort Knox.\nHer position has historic importance: it is the only office in the treasury department that is older than the department itself. Michael Hillegas, the first US treasurer, took up his post in 1775, even before the United States acquired its name a year later on 9 September.\nMs Gumataotao Rios is aware of that historic weight, but she also knows that her real link with most Americans is created through dollar banknotes.\n\"My signature is all over the world\", she says. \"It's a sense of professional pride and of personal pride for my family.\"\nThe first time she saw her name stamped on one of the green notes was the day after Thanksgiving in 2009.\nEarly in the morning, Ms Gumataotao Rios went to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington DC and was allowed to hold a freshly-printed sheet of uncut $20 notes. She was with her husband and two children, as well as the family of then-secretary Timothy Geithner, whose signature also featured.\n\"It was a very nice gift for my children, who were eight and 12 at the time. It's also their name on money,\" she adds.\nSince that day, the treasurer has kept copies of each denomination, including the recently printed new $100 note and the rare $2 bill.\n\"To have people know that a woman is representing our government is a very big milestone that has continued to this day,\" she stresses.\nShe is not the only woman to have a prominent role in the world of finance and politics, which has traditionally been male-dominated.\nFor instance, in February this year, Janet Yellen became the first female chair of the Federal Reserve, while Sylvia Mathews-Burwell, the White House budget director, has just been nominated as US health secretary by President Barack Obama.\n\"Women are playing a very significant role in economic dialogue, not just domestically but globally as well,\" says Ms Gumataotao Rios.\n\"The more we recognise that role women play, the more it will inspire future generations to also think about a career in finance and economics.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "But make no mistake - these are crucial, perhaps even momentous, times for South African politics.\nA status quo that has survived for 20 years of democracy is finally beginning to crack.\nThere is a chance this could be a good thing for South Africa - that a clumsy consensus that served the country well in the years after apartheid is no longer fit for purpose, and that a more nuanced, contested form of democracy may now take over.\nBut the governing African National Congress (ANC) does not see it like that, warning loudly that \"fascists\" and \"racists\" are threatening the survival of the institutions that have kept this country stable since 1994.\nMuch now depends on the way the ANC - after two decades of unchallenged power - deals with a more robust opposition in parliament, the erosion of a key political alliance with the trade union movement, and the dawning possibility that it may soon lose power in two of South Africa's nine provinces - and one day at a national level too.\nThursday's fighting in parliament can be traced directly to two immediate factors - one is the recent influx of MPs from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party.\nThey are unapologetically rowdy and populist, and have energised - not always in a constructive way - an institution that many South Africans, numbed by the ANC's overwhelming majority, had apparently stopped caring about.\nThe second factor is called Nkandla - the scandal about the lavish tax-payer-funded renovations to President Jacob Zuma's private home that will not disappear.\nAlthough many senior ANC figures have privately expressed deep unease about the issue, the party has publically rallied around the president in strident fashion.\nThe last straw - well, one of many - came in the shape of an ad-hoc parliamentary committee that exonerated Mr Zuma of any personal wrongdoing, after opposition members had left it in frustration.\nThe ANC then used its majority to adopt the committee's report on Thursday.\nSouth Africa's opposition is usually divided in parliament - and outside - to the advantage of the ANC.\nBut Nkandla has seen political rivals united against the governing party with unusual vigour and co-ordination.\nIt could be a sign of things to come - an opposition coalition one day strong enough to challenge the ANC's majority.\nAll of which helps explain why the current chaos in South Africa's trade union movement is also giving the ANC real cause for concern.\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has been in a strategic tri-partite alliance with the ANC and Communist Party - an arrangement that helped keep stability and achieve some progress in the labour market for decades.\nBut a combination of factors - including falling membership, political rivalries, and incidents like the Marikana mine killings of 2012 - have led to a deep split, with the biggest trade union, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), now expelled from Cosatu.\nA more competitive, vibrant trade union movement - decoupled from its leaders' increasingly cosy pact with government - may not necessarily be a bad thing for South Africa, at a time when the economy is struggling and business, government and labour urgently need to re-evaluate their relationships.\nBut again, the ANC is unlikely to react enthusiastically.\nIt has only to glance north, towards Zimbabwe, to see the potential challenge that a well-organised, union-based party can offer to a seemingly robust liberation movement.\nZimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has not ultimately triumphed in the way many predicted, but that may have as much to do with rigged elections and violence as with its own internal flaws.\nThe likelihood of a new trade union party sweeping to power in South Africa is vastly overstated.\nThis country already has a crowded opposition scene.\nBut it would certainly take more votes away from the ANC and push the governing party closer towards electoral defeat.\nIn other words, these are increasingly challenging times for South Africa's ANC.\nWill it tackle corruption, improve service delivery, harness its prodigious talents, and earn the right to many more years in power?\nOr will it scream \"fascists\" at every new challenge, ignore court orders, and - as some already fear - start to chip away at the impartiality of the independent electoral system that has served this democracy so well?", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It hosts a large technology park, which has close ties to the university, and has a large student population which boosts the local economy.\nVoters will hope that they are not faced with a repeat of the 2010 fiasco in which the polling station on Dunbabin Road ran out of ballot papers just as the polls were about to close.\nLiverpool City Council say \"the problems last time at a small number of polling stations were caused by a number of people turning up at the close of polls and not all of the polling stations had a full allocation of ballot papers.\n\"We are ensuring that all stations have a full allocation and additional training has been provided for staff. Also anyone in the queue by 22:00 BST will be given the chance to vote.\"\nSo who will be vying for those votes?\nLuciana Berger, the shadow health minister, easily held the seat for Labour five years ago with a majority of more than 7,000. She took over from Jane Kennedy - the constituency's MP since it was created in 1997 - who was elected Merseyside's Police Commissioner in 2012.\nAt one stage it looked like former Labour Councillor Jake Morrison would stand against Ms Berger. He was only 18 when he was elected in 2011 but his relationship with the party turned sour last year when he announced his retirement at the grand old age of 22.\nIf re-elected, Ms Berger says she would \"take practical action to support people who are looking for a job, for example by holding another jobs fair to bring together employers and local people. I'll promote apprenticeships and opportunities for young people and back our fantastic small businesses\".\nShe added: \"I will continue to campaign for changes to law around dangerous dogs to make our neighbourhoods safer, and I will build on my strong record of standing up for the people of Liverpool Wavertree to ensure their concerns are heard where it matters and that real change is delivered for our community.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats targeted this seat in 2010 without success. Their hopes this time around rest with 20-year-old student Leo Evans. He's pledging to protect green spaces like Calderstones Park, increase the NHS budget by ¬£8bn a year with much emphasis on mental health, work to ensure Liverpool benefits from any devolved power - especially ensuring connection to HS2 and HS3 - and continue \"the biggest expansion of apprenticeships since the 1950s\".\nJames Pearson is the Conservative's candidate.\nThe former Trafford councillor unsuccessfully stood for the Church ward in last year's Liverpool City Council elections, and this is his first parliamentary race.\nMr Pearson has three main priorities for Wavertree: He wants to support business and investment, safeguard the NHS and stand up for the armed services and their families. He feels very passionately about the last of these aims since he is an officer in the Army reserves and has served in Afghanistan and Cyprus.\nHis party won only 7.5% of the vote in 2010, however, and it would be a huge shock were they to win this time around.\nAdam Heatherington is flying the flag for UKIP, and he will be hoping to pick up votes from disaffected traditional Tories and Labour supporters alike.\nA former candidate for Liverpool Mayor, the supply teacher says more needs to be done to boost the Wavertree economy which, he says, is performing below the national average.\nHe wants to see more investment in Wavertree Technology Park where \"there's a lot of vacant offices and retail spaces‚Ä¶ business rates are just too high\".\n\"We have a brain drain in this city - too many students are leaving to work in Manchester, Leeds and London. We need more of a focus on vocational qualifications and bring them up to equal par with academic qualifications and we need more investment in our young people,\" he said.\nThe Green party is also hoping to have some impact in Wavertree. Peter Cranie, the party's former election co-ordinator, missed out on a place in the European Parliament when he stood last year.\nHe is realistic about his chances next month, admitting that the party is focusing much of their efforts on nearby Liverpool Riverside where Martin Dobson is standing. But he does believe he is giving \"everyone in Wavertree the opportunity to express their support for the more radical policies against austerity\".\n\"We think it is obscene that the five richest families in Britain own the same wealth as the 13 million least well-off,\" he said. \"That's why the Greens will commit to ending austerity and real redistribution of wealth for a fairer and better society.\"\nThe Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition are also contesting this seat. Council worker Dave Walsh is their candidate. He says he wants to \"get those who have been disenfranchised and disengaged in politics re-engaged\" as well as \"defending local services including libraries and Sure Start Centres\". The party is fielding more candidates than ever before - 130 across the country - vowing to push for an increase in the minimum hourly wage to ¬£10 and renationalise the railways.\nFinally, Leo Evans, is standing as an independent after getting a taste for politics participating in Until They Kick Us Out - a theatre production from Liverpool's Young everyman Playhouse, which deals with themes of young people and democracy.  The 18-year-old student from Edge Hill wants to support school leavers, push for a higher minimum wage, introduce rent caps for students and low income families, and improve social housing. He insists his campaign \"is more than just a protest vote\".\nWith seven candidates standing, Wavertree is one of the most highly contested constituencies on Merseyside.

His expedition was supported by the Nazis, in particular by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. Himmler was said to believe the Aryan race originated in Tibet and was keen to recover objects from the area.\nBrought back to Germany, the statue became part of a private collection and disappeared from view until 2007. A new owner then sought scientific advice on the origins. He turned to Dr Elmar Buchner from the University of Stuttgart.\n\"I was absolutely sure it was a meteorite when I saw it first, even at 10 metres\" said Dr Buchner.\nHe said that the clue was in small, thumb like impressions caused by the melting of the surface. Further analysis showed that it was a rare ataxite class, a type of meteorite not often found on Earth.\n\"It is rich in nickel, it is rich in cobalt. Less than 0.1% of all meteorites and less than 1% of iron meteorites are ataxites, so it is the rarest type of meteorites you can find.\"\nMeteorites have been seen as a sign of divine activity across many cultures since the dawn of time. Knives and jewellery were made from iron meteorites by ancient Inuit. But tracing their exact origins is often extremely difficult.\nThe German and Austrian scientists who worked on the Iron Man with Dr Buchner were surprised to be able to trace the statue to a specific event in meteorite history.\nThe researchers believe it was carved from a piece of the Chinga meteorite that fell in the border region of eastern Siberia and Mongolia about 15,000 years ago.\nThe debris from the crash was only discovered in 1913 by gold prospectors, but the individual fragment from which the statue was carved was collected many centuries before.\n\"We were quite astonished by the results,\" said Dr Buchner.\n\"OK, it's a meteorite but what amazed me was that we could also say it was from Chinga, that we could find the provenance, that was really astonishing for me.\"\nThe statue is believed to portray the god Vaisravana.

{"text": "Its last issue came out on 7 October, leaving former colleagues, friends and many others mourning something that had become beloved.\nHK Magazine was one of only a few English-language magazines in Hong Kong and had earned a reputation as fun, independent and free-thinking.\nAlthough it listed the hippest new restaurants, bars and spas, it also reported on issues such as Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China, the staggering income inequality found in the city and LGBT issues, at a time when few mainstream outlets were interested.\nMy three-year stint at HK Magazine was a dream for a rookie journalist. Right after graduation, I was given absolute freedom to chase the topics that interested me.\nI once travelled to a remote part of the city to talk to street hawkers who were being hassled by authorities during the early hours.\nI also did my very first interview with Joshua Wong for the magazine. He was only 15 at that time, but would go on to make global headlines - and the cover of TIME magazine - as the public face of Hong Kong's democracy movement.\nHK Magazine was by no means the most influential weekly in town.\nIt targeted a niche but loyal audience: expatriates and those Hong Kongers with fluent English. Many Chinese-speaking locals with little English would never have heard of it.\n\"I don't think HK Magazine had much cultural or political influence, but it did have a fun and fresh take on Hong Kong, through young expat eyes,\" said Yan Sham-Shackleton, a writer who was once based in Hong Kong.\n\"It captured the zeitgeist of that subculture, and I think if we read the magazine... it would bring back a lot of memories and a smile.\"\nHK Magazine was bought by the English-language South China Morning Post in 2013. An SCMP said it now had to shut down because it faced \"very challenging market conditions\" which were especially dire for English-language lifestyle media.\n\"The volatile advertising landscape, diminishing profitability from display advertising and event business further thwarted the magazine's sustainability in the foreseeable future,\" the statement added.\nIt did not come as a total surprise.\nEven before I left the magazine three years ago there were signs of trouble. Advertising sales, as well as circulation figures, had been falling for a while. In the first six months of 2006, HK Magazine boasted a weekly distribution of about 80,000. Last year, that plummeted to about 40,000.\n\"It reflects the demise of the print media. All print media are losing circulation or they are closing for one reason or another. This is another one,\" said Ying Chan, the founding director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong's competitive media landscape has become unforgiving in the digital age. Even Chinese-language gossip magazines like FACE and Sudden Weekly could not escape the same fate. HK Magazine will certainly not be the last casualty.\nIt is obvious that HK Magazine has faced difficult times, but the closure still prompted questions from some who believed the magazine did not make losses, even in its worst year.\nLast year, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) was itself bought by the Chinese-owned Alibaba Group.\nAlibaba certainly has money to spare. So some are asking why the company did not turn it into an online-only publication.\nThe purchase also stoked concerns about press freedom. This is understandable, because in recent years Hong Kong has seen a knife attack on one newspaper editor, the sacking of popular but outspoken columnists and evident self-censorship from some media outlets.\nBut in the case of HK Magazine, no observer is suggesting political censorship.\nAt the time of the Post's acquisition, Joseph Tsai, executive vice-chairman of Alibaba Group, said in an interview that the focus should be on building \"a global readership\", and helping people \"learn more about China\".\nZach Hines worked as HK Magazine's editor-in-chief from 2005 to early 2015. He left before Alibaba acquired the Post.\nHe said the Post was \"definitely shifting its focus away from Hong Kong\".\n\"I think their new priority is to target Western readers overseas to present coverage of mainland China.\n\"My assumption is that locally focused businesses, even beloved magazines like HK, will not be given priority.\"\nThe death of HK Magazine has led to disbelief and outrage among its loyal readers.\nBut perhaps it also invokes a greater, deeper fear: will the city of Hong Kong fade into insignificance amid the rise of China, just like the beloved HK Magazine did in the eyes of corporate managers?", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Physicists hope it could lead to discoveries that could potentially represent the biggest revolution in physics since Einstein's theories of relativity.\nAmong them is Prof Jordan Nash from Imperial College London, who is working on the CMS experiment at the LHC.\n\"We are opening a new window on the Universe and looking forward to seeing what's there,\" he said.\n\"As much as we have a lot of theories of what might be out there we don't know. We'd love to find something completely unexpected and we might, and that's the exciting bit.\"\nThey want a glimpse into a world never seen before. By smashing atoms harder than they have been smashed before physicists hope to peel back another veil of reality.\nThe aim of the various theories of physics is to explain how the Universe was formed and how the bits that make it up work.\nOne of the most successful of these theories is called the \"Standard Model\".\nIt explains how the world of the very, very small works.\nJust as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom.\nBy doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be.\nThe Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact.\nAnd just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles.\nSome are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like.\nOne of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism.\nAnother flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light.\nBut most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names.\nIn fact, one of them is actually called \"the strange quark\".\nAnd others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents: \"up\", \"down\", \"top\" and \"bottom\" though \"charm\" does sound a little more, well, charming.\nA couple of these combine in various ways to form protons and neutrons, which along with electrons make up atoms from which the world is made. These are all members of a group called \"fermions\".\nAnd there is another group called the \"bosons\", that quite literally hold the place together.\nThey are called the \"force carriers\" in physics text books and give rise to the forces of nature: electrical, magnetic and nuclear forces, which pull other particles together or push them apart.\nWith the discovery of the sub-atomic world's biggest celeb of all, the Higgs boson, scientists have now detected all the particles predicted by the Standard Model: a theory that beautifully explains how the Universe works in intricate detail.\nOr so scientists thought.\nIt is incomplete. For a long time physicists thought that their Standard Model theory could explain almost everything.\nThen came two phenomena that showed that it explained hardly anything.\nFirst was the observation that galaxies are rotating much more quickly than they should.\nThe faster a galaxy rotates the more material it contains.\nThe observations suggested that they contain five times more material than could be detected.\nThis invisible material has been called \"dark matter\" which physicists believe accounts for a quarter of the Universe.\nSecond was the observation that galaxies were accelerating apart from each other driven by an even more mysterious force that the researchers who discovered it called \"dark energy\".\nSo all in all the Standard Model, brilliant though it is at explaining how our tiny corner of the cosmos works can't account for how the remaining 95% of the Universe works.\nEven then, of the 5% it is good for it can't explain gravity.\nAnd, just as the erstwhile poster child of physics slinks off to find a place to curl up and quietly weep, comes the biggest humiliation of all: it can't explain why the Universe exists at all.\nShortly after the Big Bang there were equal amounts of matter, from which all the atoms, stars and planets are made and anti-matter.\nMoments later the two should have cancelled each other out, as ripples sometimes do when meeting in a pond, to create a gigantic blast of energy and then, nothing but light.\nOur very existence demonstrates that clearly this did not happen.\nYou might have thought that this was bad news for physics - but actually physicists such as Prof Nash couldn't be more excited.\n\"It's our biggest opportunity in a generation to find out what's the next step, where do we go from here and how do we explain the things we don't understand about the composition of the Universe.\"\nThat is what physicists are hoping for. With the Large Hadron Collider set to double its energy, physicists hope that they will discovery weirder and even more wonderful particles that will point the way to a new more complete theory of sub-atomic physics.\nIn other words a sequel, with new even more bizarre characters and with no doubt some twists and turns in the plot.\nBook two has the working title of: \"Beyond the Standard Model\".\nScientists hope to find evidence of the invisible \"stuff\" called dark matter: the unseen Cheshire Cat behind the grin of the visible Universe we see around us.\nThere are lots of different theories for what the cat might look like.\nAmong them is an idea called supersymmetry or \"Susy\" for short.\nThis idea predicts new particles that are invisible partners of the ones we know already about.\nOne of these could be dark matter.\nAnother idea is that dark matter could be explained by the wonderfully evocatively named \"dark sector\".\nThis comprises shadowy new particles that don't obey the same forces as everything else but cannot easily be detected. They might be the invisible culprits that have been making our galaxies rotate faster than they should.\nResearchers will also be looking to find particles that are manifestations of extra-dimensions that we cannot detect but are predicted in some theories that extend the Standard Model to incorporate gravity.\nAnd the LHCb experiment will be studying the differences between matter and anti-matter in unprecedented detail.\nWho knows, but possibly one of the biggest changes in thinking in physics for 100 years.\nResearchers, such as Prof Tara Shears of Liverpool University who is working on the LHCb experiment hope to have their first taste of so-called \"new physics: a set of discoveries that will radically transform the theories of physics and our knowledge of how the Universe works.\n\"If I could have just one outcome form the next run of the LHC this would be it,\" she explained with a far away look in her eyes.\n\"It would be to make a discovery so unexpected that it doesn't fit with any of our theories, something that would show us that we have been on the wrong track in our efforts to understand the way that the forces of nature work, the way that matter is composed, something that will knock our heads sideways to make us come from a new direction.\n\"And that would be the paradigm shift and that shift, in my dreams would lead us to a much deeper understanding of the Universe.\n\"It would be wonderful if we could make a head start that would point us in the right direction.\"\nThe sub-atomic world is set to become \"curiouser and curiouser\".\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It takes 28 days for registration to become effective.\nMobile phone numbers can also be registered, although this will not prevent unsolicited text messages.\nIt is a legal requirement that all organisations - including charities, voluntary organisations and political parties - do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless they have the individual's consent to do so.\nTelephone Preference Service\nThe rules do not apply when people consent to their details being used for marketing purposes.\nBut BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said members of the public continued to get unwanted calls - often pre-recorded - despite being registered with the TPS.\nThat was because not all companies were members of the Direct Marketing Association - the UK telemarketing industry body - some were overseas and some were \"good old-fashioned fraudsters\" out to steal money, he said.\nThe problem of unwanted calls may never be fully eradicated, he added.\nRepeat offenders include firms inquiring about mis-sold payment protection insurance.\nFirms which flout the TPS rules can currently be fined up to √Ç¬£500,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office.\nThose which break media regulator Ofcom rules on silent and abandoned calls face fines of up to √Ç¬£2m.\nCritics say the system is not working because rules on enforcement are skewed in favour of rogue firms.\nUnder Culture Secretary Maria Miller's plans, the current \"substantial damage\" threshold could be lowered.\nThey would also make it simpler for regulators such as Ofcom, the Insolvency Service and the Information Commissioner's Office to swap data about who the offenders might be.\nAnd the Ministry of Justice will launch a consultation on Monday on whether firms that break the rules should face fines of up to 20% of their annual turnover.\n\"Nuisance calls must stop,\" Ms Miller said.\n\"At best they are an irritation and an unwanted intrusion; at worst they cause real distress and fear, particularly to the elderly or housebound.\n\"People need to feel safe and secure in their homes.\n\"The rules are clear - people have the right to choose not to receive unsolicited marketing calls.

{"text": "Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years.\nSome experts are sceptical of the Human Reproduction Update findings.\nBut lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen in the future.\nThe assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011.\nDr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct.\n\"If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future,\" he said.\n\"Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species.\"\nScientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion.\nDr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing.\nIn contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.\nMany previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.\nSome have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.\nThere is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not.\nAnother difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count.\nTaken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts.\nBut the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical.\nHe said: \"I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past.\"\n\"However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies.\"\nBut Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the results should be treated with caution.\n\"The debate has not yet been resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done.\n\"However, the paper does represent a step forward in the clarity of the data which might ultimately allow us to define better studies to examine this issue.\"\nThere is no clear evidence for the reason for this apparent decrease. But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress, diet, and even watching too much TV.\nDr Levine says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend.\n\"We must take action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I won't get involved anymore because I am not being bullied.\"\nSince victory at the Masters in January, five-time world champion O'Sullivan has only replied to questions by the media with one or two-word answers, and has also sung an Oasis song in reply, and on another occasion responded as a 'robot' in protest at his perceived mistreatment by the sport's authorities.\nIf I did not have good lawyers, I would probably have walked away because I am too old to be dealing with things like that\nThat grievance seemingly dates to an incident during his record-breaking seventh Masters triumph at Alexandra Palace, when he publicly criticised a referee and swore at a photographer.\nWorld Snooker, the commercial arm of the sport, referred O'Sullivan's comments to governing body the WPBSA, which ultimately took no action as it accepted his explanation of the incidents.\nHowever, O'Sullivan was sent a letter by the WPBSA about his behaviour and warned he could face further sanctions including a fine.

Temperature records indicate that the summer was about 5% cooler than 2012.\nThe scientists believe that the more accurate measurements that they have now published show that sea ice is more sensitive to changes than previously thought. They argue that while some could see this as a positive, when temperatures are cooler it leads to an increase in sea ice, it could also be a negative when the mercury goes up.\n\"It would suggest that sea ice is more resilient perhaps - if you get one year of cooler temperatures, we've almost wound the clock back a few years on this gradual decline that's been happening over decades,\" said Rachel Tilling.\n\"The long-term trend of the ice volume is downwards and the long-term trend of the temperatures in the Arctic is upwards and this finding doesn't give us any reason to disbelieve that - as far as we can tell it's just one anomalous year.\"\nThe updated data has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "But in a separate poll, the town where officials plan to carry out a scientific trial, voted to reject the proposal.\nThe planned release is being seen as an important test for the technology's acceptance in the US.\nFlorida has reported more than 1,100 cases of Zika this year.\nBritish biotech firm Oxitec plans to evaluate the effectiveness of their engineered mosquitoes for combating the virus.\nThey want to release male insects across a 17-hectare region of Key Haven, a small suburb located on an island on Florida's southern tip.\nZika is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The idea is that Oxitec's male mosquitoes (which do not bite) mate with wild females, but genetic modification ensures that any offspring do not survive until adulthood.\nSuccessive releases across the neighbourhood should cause Aedes aegypti populations to crash.\nThe non-binding poll in Monroe County, which covers the Florida Keys and a large part of the Everglades National Park, asked: \"Are you in favour of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District conducting an effectiveness trial in Monroe County, Florida, using genetically modified mosquitoes to suppress an invasive mosquito that carries mosquito-borne diseases?\"\nVoters in Key Haven were asked specifically about the release of GM mosquitoes in their town.\nAbout 58% of voters across Monroe County favoured the trial. But in Key Haven, some 65% opposed the release.\nNow, the results of the November 8 poll will be put to board members in charge of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. They will use the results to decide whether to proceed with the scientific trial at a meeting on 19 November.\nDr Derric Nimmo, who has been leading Oxitec's proposed trial in Key Haven, told BBC News: \"Key Haven was chosen about four years ago, based on the fact that it's surrounded by water and it's an almost perfect scientific site where you have a control area where you don't do any releases, an area where you can do releases, and a buffer zone in between.\n\"You don't want wild female mosquitoes coming into the area, because they will affect the quality of the results.\"\nOxitec has previously conducted five trials in three different countries - the Cayman Islands, Panama and Brazil, where Dr Nimmo says, the company achieves reductions in mosquito populations of 90% or more.\nAedes aegypti is an urban mosquito that can breed in bodies of standing water as small as a bottle cap. Its larvae can find refuge indoors, beyond the reach of insecticide spraying programmes.\nBut a proportion of local residents wanted the trial cancelled; they have been concerned about potential unanticipated consequences of releasing lab insects into the wild.\nMila de Mier, a Florida realtor who has founded an opposition group called Never Again, told BBC News: \"This technology is treated as an animal drug, but we believe it should be treated as a human drug.\"\nShe added her concern that \"when you reduce the population of Aedes aegypti, another aggressive mosquito species could come in and become established - like the Asian tiger mosquito\".\nBut Dr Nimmo stressed: \"We've had six years of releases, involving millions of male mosquitoes, and there have been no reports of any adverse effects.\"\n\"It's important we're as transparent as possible... we've been trying to give people the facts and information so they can make an informed choice.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Along with the Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy, he disproved the idea that dance music couldn't sell albums, and helped to establish modern DJ culture.\nTwenty years later, Fatboy remains the most successful pseudonym of songwriter Norman Cook - whose other projects include The Housemartins, Beats International and Freak Power.\nTo celebrate two decades of dance, Cook opened up his photo album to the BBC.\nThe fun of Fatboy Slim at the start was nobody knew who I was. I was never in the videos and I never had my photo on the cover. It suited me really well to be known as an underground dance producer. The fame I had in the Housemartins didn't sit right with me.\nSo you can probably detect a slight reticence in that photo session. I'm saying, \"the whole point of hiding behind pseudonyms was I'd never have to do this again!\"\nAnd then I met Zoe [Ball - his wife] which just kicked the whole thing out of obscurity into the tabloids...\nYour t-shirt says \"wild style lifestyle\". How crazy did it get?\nIt was very wild. About as wild as you can be and still retain your health and your sanity.\nDid you ever worry you had gone too far?\nThere were worries on the health and sanity things over the years. But at that point, I was definitely pushing the boundaries of altered states of consciousness and behaviour.\nHow did that affect the music?\nI think it helped it tremendously. When I was having my real purple period, I'd have a big weekend, then come Sunday evening, I couldn't operate heavy machinery or drive anywhere - so I'd just go into the studio.\nI would sit there with my little samples and, having taken a mental snapshot of the weekend - mental being the operative word - I would try and sum that up in music.\nI was unfettered by sanity at that point.\nDo you find it harder now?\nI do, yeah. The ways I was using in those days are not an option now. Sometimes I do think I'd be more creative if I could still unlock that subconscious part of my brain. But no-one can have a 30-year purple period. It can't be sustained.\nThat's actually my studio wall at the time of [1998 album] You've Come A Long Way Baby.\nIt was a kind of mood board, because I'd spend a huge chunk of my life in the studio. It was something to look at when I was bored.\nIt's lovely because there's tons of old faces there. Ashley Slater [1], who was in Freak Power with me. Rec One [2], the graffiti artist in Beats International who did a lot of my original artwork. There's Lindy Layton (vocalist on Dub Be Good To Me) [3] at the top looking beautiful and waving.\nMy ex-girlfriend, Bella [4] is there wearing the spotty hat. And then Ashley with a very young Davina McCall [5], hanging out with us in Cannes. We had a very funny night out with her.\nArpy [6] was an ex-flatmate and, because the studio was in the house, she'd be subjected to whatever I was working on at the time. If I'd worked on a tune for more than 12 hours and she hadn't come in and gone, \"ooh, I like this one\", I'd scrap it.\nCook road-tested much of his material at the Big Beat Boutique, a weekly night in Brighton's Concorde club. The event eventually lent its name to the genre he pioneered.\nThere was a feeling that the first album [Better Living Through Chemistry] had established a new genre and if we refined it, it could go bigger. But we never dreamed how big it could go.\nThere were hints. The Big Beat Boutique held about 300 people but we realised that if everybody who'd ever come to the Boutique turned up on the same night we'd have 2,000 people. And if we put those 2,000 people in a tent and played them the same music, they'd go more nuts than they did in a smaller place. So there was a feeling that we could take the formula bigger.\nThe thing I like the most about that picture is my cheeky, innocent smile. I actually looked at this with my wife the other day and she said, \"that is exactly what you looked like when I met you!\"\nI dare say I make that face to this day. But a slightly craggier version.\nCook's plans to scale up the Big Beat Boutique became reality in 2001, when Brighton's seafront hosted an outdoor festival called the Big Beach Boutique. But the second instalment, in July 2002, ended in chaos when 250,000 people turned up. He wasn't allowed to stage it again until 2007.\nBig Beach Boutique 2 was almost a disaster. Or rather, the people who read about it in the tabloids thought it was a disaster. The quarter of a million people who were there thought it was the best thing that ever happened to Brighton - and that included people from the council.\nSo we came up with a plan with the police and the council. They said the only way we could do it was to hold it on the most unpopular day of the year. Well, New Year's Day on the beach on the south coast of England is probably the last place you'd ever want to be.\nIt was quite a leap of faith to expect people to turn out in freezing cold conditions with rain coming sideways at them off the beach. I was getting electrocuted because I was soaking wet. Poor old David Guetta had to stop playing because his equipment got so wet that it stopped working.\nWe got away with it by the skin of our teeth.\nThat was one of my many record boxes. They were our bread and butter. They contained our career and our lives. You never travelled anywhere without them - they became like an extension of you.\nI was thinking the other day about how DJ culture has changed - and one of the things is you don't have the same sense of brotherhood. If you were sitting in the airport, you'd know another DJ because they had a record box. So you'd immediately try to work out from the stickers who they were - and then you'd get into a conversation with them.\nWe considered ourselves outlaws because no-one really respected us and we lived outside the normal working hours. Nowadays, everyone is a DJ.\nI've no idea where that record box is. In those days they were 10-a-penny so you'd wear them out and give them away as a prize or something. If anyone reading this has got one, can you please get in touch with me because I'd happily buy it back.\nThat's in Gorky Park, where we went over and did a big festival in 2001.\nWe didn't expect people in Moscow to have understood or embraced rave culture. But it was a beautiful sunny day and there were tons of raving Russians. Somebody felt excited enough to encapsulate the day by writing all over himself in biro!\nAs I remember, my passage into Russia was a lot easier than my passage out. The right people had been paid off to ensure we made it into the country, because they'd sold 20,000 tickets and they wanted to make sure we were there. On the way out, things didn't run quite so smoothly.\nIt was quite Wild West... It still is when you go and play out there. You do figure that the promoters aren't 100% legitimate in their business behaviour, and they all carry guns.\nMy wife said: \"That's not you - that's you trying to look cool and moody. With varying degrees of success.\"\nI'm wearing the t-shirt for Skint Records' birthday. I've always been a smiley collector. It's a goofy, disarming icon. The idea of greeting someone with a smile is a universal, timeless thing. It captures a moment of silly, '60s goofiness that has been appropriated by hedonists and friendly people ever since.\nI've got a smiley tattoo - so I love the fact that every five years some designer will decide its fashionable again - because then my tattoo becomes in vogue again.\nAn special edition of Fatboy Slim's second album You've Come A Long Way Baby is out now.

{"text": "For a man supposedly worth millions, you would not know it by his boots. When the BBC interviewed Col Gaddafi in March, I was expecting the meeting to take place at a secret desert pavilion. Instead it was a seaside restaurant in central Tripoli. His eyes were hidden behind gold Cartier sunglasses. His flowing brown robes gave off the light scent of sandalwood. \"I don't like money,\" he said. \"I have a tent\". One look at his black cowboy boots and you would think he was telling the truth. The soles were cracked and pitted, the heels worn. Last week, when I walked around his Bab al-Aziziya compound on the day it fell, I saw where the money had gone. He had a tent like no other tent in the world. But by the end of the day it was just ashes.\nThe next image shows the last big demonstration in the Tripoli area of Tajoura before the authorities cracked down with pre-dawn raids and mass arrests. It was just after prayers one Friday in March. I went back the following week when the BBC team broke away from their government minders at the Rixos Hotel. There was no demonstration. The anti-Gaddafi graffiti had been painted over and the local imam told us many young people had been taken away during the night. Soon after we turned up, government heavies arrived in minivans to take us away. This was the last time journalists were able to move easily around the capital before it fell five months later.\nThe next audience with Col Gaddafi was on 2 March, the anniversary of the \"establishment of the people's authority\". This is when Col Gaddafi says he handed over all power to the people, so he could not technically stand down. The crowd was delighted, the rest of us bemused because he arrived in a brand new golf buggy, its front seat draped with a white sheepskin rug. He talked for three hours. Occasionally he allowed some chants and cheers, and then tapped his microphone, at which the crowd promptly shut up. The last time I saw Col Gaddafi, he was driving his buggy towards a lamp post. But his security team cleared a path and he drove off with two secret service types clinging to the back.\nThis was one of the government soldiers who had taken back the town of Zawiya, near Tripoli, from the rebels. The fighting was brutal as was the treatment of those arrested by the authorities. Some BBC colleagues were detained for 24 hours and subjected to mock executions. When journalists did get in, it was by media bus under strict supervision of the authorities, but the green-and-white bunting could not hide the scale of the destruction. The makeshift cemetery in the town square, where the rebels had buried their fallen fighters, had been bulldozed. The rebels winning it back proved to be a turning point in the war.\nThe man below was typical of the rebel fighters on the eastern front outside Ajdabiya in April. They were mostly disorganised and ill-disciplined. He was among those who fled at the first sign of an incoming round. It was at this time that the Libyan government was trying to push the idea that these fighters were linked to al-Qaeda. We tended to see them as more of a danger to themselves than to us. Their evolution into a proper fighting force took many months and some training from foreign military experts. Combined with a steady stream of new weapons and Nato's air campaign, over time they became a force to be reckoned with.\nYears of being silenced have led to an explosion of graffiti in Libyan towns and cities. Artists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities in Tripoli - they sprayed by night and government lackeys whitewashed by day. This wall - in Liberation Square in Misrata - is in no danger of being repainted. Less artistic but more poignant was graffiti by the family of Abdel Salem Fouzy Alshaba, a 23-year-old economics student. The day after I took this picture, I watched him die at a hospital on the city's western front line. He sustained head and back injuries from a grad rocket fired by Gaddafi forces. Within days, his family was using a spray can to rename streets across the city in his honour.\nThis building in the Bab al-Aziziya compound is where Col Gaddafi made most of his anti-Western speeches. It was bombed in 1986 by US warplanes in revenge for a nightclub bombing in Germany that targeted US servicemen. The fist crushing the US fighter jet symbolised Col Gaddafi's defiance. After the compound fell to rebel forces, young men were queuing to have their photo taken on it. A few days later, someone \"liberated\" the famous fist from its mount and it has not been seen since.\nThey could not get to the man so they were tearing apart everything he owned. This was inside Gaddafi's compound, where I watched rebels walking away with vases, paintings and fridges. What they could not carry, they smashed to pieces. Comparisons have been drawn with the fall of Baghdad, raising fears of what may follow. But Tripoli is a very different story. Only symbols of the regime have been attacked. The rest of the city has remained largely secure.\nThis would have got this young boy's family in a lot of trouble a few months ago. But the images people were once forced to mount at their homes and businesses are now used to show their contempt for the regime. This was outside a hospital in Misrata. But everywhere in Tripoli, people are walking over images of the self-styled father of the nation. Libyans have lived with the cult of Gaddafi for more than four decades. No-one knows where he is hiding, but what is clear is that this young Libyan is not going to grow up like his parents - in Col Gaddafi's shadow.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Applying a small current to specific parts of the brain can increase its activity, making learning easier.\nResearchers from the University of Oxford have studied the changing structure of the brain in stroke patients and in healthy adults.\nProf Heidi Johansen-Berg presented their findings at the British Science Festival in Bradford.\nThe team at Oxford has been conducting research into how the structure of the brain changes in adulthood, and in particular what changes occur after a stroke.\nThey have used an approach called functional MRI to monitor activity in the brain as stroke patients re-learn motor skills that were lost as a result of their illness.\nOne of the major findings is that the brain is very flexible and can restructure itself, growing new connections and reassigning tasks to different areas, when damage occurs or a specific task is practised.\nAs part of this research, they investigated the possibility of using non-invasive electric brain stimulation to improve the recovery of these motor skills; the short-term improvement in stroke patients had already been noted.\nBut an unexpected result was found when the same brain stimulation was applied to healthy adults: their speed of learning was also significantly increased.\nTo observe this effect, the team devised an experiment whereby volunteers memorised a sequence of buttons to press \"like playing a tune on a piano\".\nWhile they were doing this, they were fitted with a \"trans-cranial current stimulation\" device, in which two electrodes are placed in a specific position on the head.\nA very small current was passed between the electrodes in an arc through the brain and, depending on the direction of that current, either increased or decreased the activity of that part of the brain.\nProf Johansen-Berg explained that \"an increase in activity of the brain cells makes them more susceptible to the kinds of changes that occur during learning\".\nThe results of the button-pressing experiments showed the positive effects of just 10 minutes of the brain stimulation on learning, compared to a similar \"placebo\" setup in which the electrical stimulation was not used.\n\"While the stimulation didn't improve the participant's best performance, the speed at which they reached their best was significantly increased,\" said Prof Johansen-Berg.\nTargeting the area of the brain that controls motor skills allows movement tasks to be learned more quickly, and the researchers envisage the technique could be used to help in the training of athletes.\nThe experiments have explicitly shown that stimulating the motor cortex of the brain can increase the speed of learning motor skills.\nIt is the hope of the researchers that the same method may be applied to other parts of the brain to improve educational learning, simply by positioning the electrodes in different locations so the current is focussed on the correct area.\nThe relative simplicity, low price (around √Ç¬£2,000 per unit), and portability of the technology may mean that, following further research, a device could be designed to be automated for use at home.\nLooking to the future, Prof Johansen-Berg and her team plan to investigate the potential for increasing the effect, by stimulating daily over a period of weeks to months.\nIn the treatment of stroke patients, the technique could be used in parallel with current physiotherapy treatments to improve overall outcomes, which tend to vary widely.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Perhaps one criticism that could be levelled at Aberdeen was how they had not managed to score before they did.\nThe breakthrough came from a set piece. Hayes floated a great free-kick to Taylor, whose header was equally accurate and found the corner.\nIncredibly, Hamilton were almost immediately handed a route back into the match.\nTaylor blundered to let Redmond in on Lewis, who appeared to hesitate, allowing the midfielder to nick the ball.\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball, but it was not clear whether he had taken the man first. No matter, the referee gave the penalty, which Imrie fired home confidently.\nAberdeen responded well to that set-back, with Woods superbly tipping Taylor's drive over before Rooney appeared to be pushed in the box, but pleas were ignored.\nThe Dons went forward relentlessly. Manager Derek McInnes made a positive move, bringing on Maddison for Considine and it proved decisive.\nIt was Maddison's shot that Woods palmed back into play perfectly for the onrushing Rooney to net.\nMcMann prevented a third, hauling Hayes to the ground just outside the box that earned a red card with the winger in on goal.\nNo-one could realistically argue Aberdeen did not deserve the win. What is unclear is how they did not make it far more comfortable\nIt was a fourth successive defeat for Hamilton, albeit in a very tough run of fixtures. What will be more alarming for manager Martin Canning is the lack of wins in the last two months.\nAt times, the visitors were hanging on by a thread, struggling to contain the attacking threat they faced.\nThey had a fabulous chance for a second shortly before Rooney's goal and that would have made a huge difference.\nShay Logan gave possession away, Rakish Bingham surged clear and found Ali Crawford, but the midfielder could not get enough on his shot to beat Lewis while the goalkeeper was grounded. He should have scored.\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We passed up so many opportunities. It was one-way traffic in the first half.\n\"By and large I felt we were on the wrong end of a few decisions today and I thought we still managed to thoroughly deserve three points.\n\"Reynolds scores a perfectly valid goal.

This to me is a fabrication coming from a political conspiracy to stop my political career,\" Mr Anwar told the court.\nHe told the judges: \"You have become partners in crime in the murder of judicial independence,\" prompting them to get up and walk out of the room, AP news agency reported.\nMr Anwar tweeted a statement later in the day, saying he would not be silenced.\nHis daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar, herself a politician, told the BBC that the opposition would hold a meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss \"the next course of action\".\nShe said she hoped her father's jailing would galvanise both the opposition and the electorate.\n\"I hope Malaysians will wake up... the only way to ensure normal... justice takes place is through the ballot box,\" she told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme.\nIn this most recent case, Mr Anwar was accused of having sex with a male political aide in 2008. Sodomy is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, though very few people are ever prosecuted.\nHe was cleared by a High Court of the charges in 2012 because of a lack of evidence. The government then appealed and his acquittal was overturned. It is Mr Anwar's appeal against this ruling that has now been rejected.\nThe popular politician was previously imprisoned for six years for sodomy and corruption after being ousted as deputy prime minister in 1998.\nHe was freed in 2004 and went on to lead his three-party alliance to unprecedented gains in the 2008 and 2013 elections. In the latter, the ruling Barisan Nasional, which has been in power since 1957, suffered its worst-ever result.\nReading the verdict, Judge Arifin Zakat said there was \"overwhelming evidence\" against Mr Anwar and upheld the conviction.\nThe court subsequently reaffirmed the five-year jail sentence, as a few hundred of Mr Anwar's supporters protested outside.\nAhead of the verdict, Mr Anwar, 67, said there was \"no reason whatsoever for them to ever consider putting me to jail\".\n\"I am innocent,\" he said. \"Now in the event there's a political decision to put me in jail, I understand the system, I've served time in prison... But then this is a price I have to pay.\"\nAt the scene: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Putrajaya\nThere were tears and hugs for the Malaysian opposition leader from his family after his conviction was confirmed by the Federal Court. He had half expected this verdict, but, at the age of 67, has been dreading it too.\nFor 16 years Anwar Ibrahim has dominated Malaysian opposition politics, and for almost as long he has been fighting the same judicial battle against charges he and most human rights groups have always said were politically-motivated.\nHe is the first opposition leader to pose a serious challenge to the governing party's hold on power, using his own charisma and negotiating skills to bring three very different parties into a coalition which managed to win the popular vote at the last election, although not a majority of parliamentary seats.\nMr Anwar must now serve a five-year jail sentence and a five-year ban from office. It will be hard for him to bounce back again, and hard for the opposition Pakatan coalition to hold together without him.\nBut it will be just as hard for the government to reverse its flagging popularity, after a verdict many Malaysians will see as a cynical manoeuvre to remove a man it has long seen as its principal threat. Riven by factional infighting and tainted by corruption allegations, the government's problems are not solved by putting Anwar Ibrahim behind bars once again.\nHuman Rights Watch accused Prime Minister Najib Razak's government of persisting with a \"politically motivated prosecution\" of Mr Anwar.\n\"Allowing this travesty of justice to stand will further undermine respect for rights and democracy in Malaysia,\" said the group's Asia director Phil Robertson.\nIn an emailed statement, a Malaysian government spokesman said \"exhaustive and comprehensive due process\" had been followed.\n\"The judges will have reached their verdict only after considering all the evidence in a balanced and objective manner.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "In 2010, the 34-year-old Englishman was going to meeting after meeting in California's Silicon Valley, trying to secure funding for his business idea - Nutmeg, an online-based investment management business.\nAnd the first 45 wealthy investors he pitched to all said no.\n\"It was horrible,\" he says. \"The feedback was very personal.\n\"Some investors said they liked the idea, but that I couldn't do it. Others said they didn't like the idea, and some simply said I wasn't good enough.\n\"It was really brutal, I hugely questioned myself.\"\nAt the time Mr Hungerford, who was in Silicon Valley after completing a Master of Business Administration from nearby Stanford University, was sleeping on the floor of a friend's house, and working out of his garage.\n\"I was living the entrepreneurial dream that had turned into a horrific reality,\" he says.\nIt was the autumn of 2010 at this point, and Mr Hungerford was running out of money, maxing out his credit cards to cover his living expenses.\nHe says: \"I drew a line in the sand, and said that if I haven't got a 'yes' by December I would go and get a job.\"\nThen Mr Hungerford secured another investment meeting, his 46th, this time with a man called Tim Draper.\nMr Draper may be little known outside of technology circles, but he was an early investor in Hotmail and Skype, and is worth an estimated $1bn (√Ç¬£620m).\nAfter listening to Mr Hungerford's pitch, Mr Draper was quick to say yes. Other wealthy investors soon followed suit.\n\"I felt so vindicated,\" says Mr Hungerford.\nWith \"tens of millions of dollars\" now behind him, he never did need to look through the job advertisements.\nInstead, he was able to start Nutmeg in early 2011, choosing to return to the UK to launch the firm in London.\nNutmeg itself is an investment management business. You give it your savings, and it will invest them on your behalf in everything from shares to property, and bonds to currencies.\nWhile there are thousands of such firms around the world, Nutmeg's difference is that it claims to have been the very first to base itself online.\nSo instead of having to phone your investment manager at some big bank in the City of London, or relying on a statement sent to you in the post every six months, you simply log into Nutmeg's website, and you can instantly see your portfolio and how it is performing.\nIn analysing small business growth it is sometimes useful to distinguish between \"lifestyle firms\" and \"growth firms\".\nThe former are set up by individuals who prefer being self-employed to working for someone else, but are essentially looking for a stable income.\nGrowth firms, on the other hand, such as today's successful online firms, are founded by traditional risk-taking, innovative entrepreneurs.\nThey respond positively to new opportunities and incentives to undertake risk, and they are focused on process and product innovation.\nJoseph Schumpeter - a famous inter-war economist - described these growth firms as the agents of \"creative destruction\".\nFor him they were the bedrock of modern capitalism - introducing a stream of innovative products and services that would destroy many existing businesses and, in their place, create new ones.\nBecause of its online model, and the fact it has a modest office in south London rather than an expensive one in the City, Mr Hungerford says Nutmeg has significantly lower overheads than its larger, more traditional rivals.\nAs a result, he says it charges substantially lower annual fees - as low as 0.3% compared with an industry average of 1.37%.\nAt the same time, people can invest just √Ç¬£1,000 with it, as opposed to the minimum of √Ç¬£500,000 with many large investment management firms.\nMr Hungerford says: \"Historically this industry was only open to the very wealthy, but we want to democratise investing, to open it up to far more people.\"\nHe adds that he wants Nutmeg to do to investing what Amazon did to online retailing - to grow to dominate the marketplace, and be available to everyone.\nAfter two years of development work, Nutmeg opened for business in January 2013, and now has more than 35,000 customers, and is one of the fastest growing financial firms in the UK.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, at least six companies around the world have now followed Nutmeg's business model, while the big banks have been keen to find out more.\nMr Hungerford says: \"Pretty much every chief executive of a big bank or big asset management company [in the UK] has come in to see us, to find out more about us, and what we are up to.\"\nYet he adds that \"the big incumbents are reluctant to follow our model because they are making so much money\" just targeting the super-rich investor.\nBorn in Bristol, and brought up just outside Bath, Mr Hungerford is the son of a vicar and a nurse.\nHe says he got his love of finance from his grandmother, who gave him investment books \"when he was eight or nine\".\nAfter gaining a degree in economics from Exeter University he moved to London, where he worked in investment banking for Barclays and Brewin Dolphin for seven years.\nEventually, determined to set up his own company, Mr Hungerford quit his job, and went to Stanford, where his idea for Nutmeg took shape.\nBut where did the unusual name come from?\n\"We tested 519 names over six months,\" says Mr Hungerford. \"We eventually chose Nutmeg because it used to be the most valuable spice in the world, wars were fought over it. And of course now it is available to everyone, which is a great parallel.\"\nHe adds that Nutmeg now plans to continue to focus primarily on the UK market. Any future expansion to the US will only be possible when an American regulatory change allows such investment firms to operative via the internet.\n\"I could have stayed working in the City, but I realised I wasn't particularly fulfilled with my life,\" says Mr Hungerford.\n\"I got the entrepreneurial bug, and decided I needed to go to business school to learn how to run and grow a business.

{"text": "From April 2015 millions of people reaching retirement age will be able to spend their pension pot in any way they want.\nIn effect, the move will remove the requirement on many people with defined contribution pensions to buy an annuity, a financial product that guarantees an income for the rest of your life.\nThe government says that the overhaul will give retirees more flexibility to do what they want with their pension savings, but Labour says this policy has the potential to be \"reckless\".\nSo what are the potential hidden consequences?\nThis scenario has been much discussed immediately after the chancellor's Budget speech, but George Osborne says that new pensioners can be trusted to organise their own finances.\nSome people might decide that their pension pot, locked up during their working life, will provide a nice lump sum to use to celebrate retirement with a holiday of a lifetime, a massive party, or - as the pension minister admitted - a Lamborghini sports car.\nBut it will be clear to all that in doing so, they take away the option of using those savings when money is tight in retirement, especially if they underestimate how long they will live for.\nThe new flat-rate state pension will provide just over ¬£7,000 a year of income to fall back on - described by the chancellor as \"generous\", but much lower than the vast majority of people are used to during their working life. At times, individuals will receive this years after they have access to their defined contribution pension pot.\nIn Australia, where people are already able to withdraw lump sums easily, recent evidence suggests that most retirees invest the money or use it to clear debts, but a few choose to buy holidays or cars.\nFreed of the need to put their pension savings into an annuity, new pensioners may decide to use the money to invest in property instead.\nMark Giddens, partner of accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, says: \"With pensioners no longer being railroaded into investing in annuities, they will be looking for other higher-yielding investments - that inevitably means a huge boost to buy-to-let investments.\n\"Unfortunately, it is often the case that the higher the yield, the higher the risk.\"\nThere is also one other big hole in this theory. The City watchdog's recent review of annuities found that the average pension pot was only ¬£17,700. That is hardly enough for a deposit, let alone a house or flat.\nAnyone who decides to take all their money in one go will not escape the taxman.\nMost computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader\nDownload the reader here\n\"This [plan] gives people the key to unlock their pensions and take money out, but they must remember that there are tax implications,\" says Anne Redston, professor of law at King's College, London.\nPut simply, the money will be categorised as income, and so will be subject to income tax. Anyone taking out a large amount in one go might find 40% income tax is levied on some of it.\nInstead, retirees might decide to take it out in small chunks over the years, stick with an annuity, or seek advice for tax planning.\nRetired people are usually top of the hit-list among con artists.\nNow, it is likely that people approaching retirement will be targeted with a string of investment scams.\nRogue operators will know that catching someone just as they have access to their pension pot could be very lucrative. The advice, as always, is that a deal that looks too good to be true usually is, and that no decision needs to be taken immediately.\nThis Budget was dubbed as a victory for pensioners, but this new flexible arrangement will not be available to most existing pensioners at all.\nThe new system is planned to be introduced fully in April 2015, but only for the 320,000 or so who retire each year with a defined contribution pension pot.\nThose who have already bought an annuity are receiving their annual pension income and are locked into that deal for the rest of their life.\nIf this annuity was bought in the past few years, the likelihood is that it was not a very good deal, because of economic conditions and monetary policy. So the recently retired may feel as though they have missed out on greater choice and better deals.\nMillions of people are being signed up to defined contribution pensions, through the automatic enrolment workplace pension scheme.\nIt is very difficult to work out at this stage whether the changes will be better or worse for those who still decide to choose an annuity when they reach retirement.\nLess demand could mean insurance companies are unable to offer such good deals, but fewer customers might mean they need to be more competitive.\n\"The new rules might mean that annuity companies improve the rates they offer. The excess profits made from captive customers will hopefully disappear,\" says Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nBut Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: \"It will likely make annuities even more expensive for those who do want to buy them.\"\nAnnuity companies may also concentrate on offering other types of financial product for pensioners, such as bonds.\nThe amount of money tucked away in pension pots might not be very big - not enough, as mentioned earlier, for most to buy a property.\nYet, a significant chunk of cash could be used as a loan to grandchildren who are struggling to get on the housing ladder, or facing the cost of paying for further education.\nHowever, as explained earlier, taking out a big chunk of money in one go will probably lead to an income tax charge for Gran and Grandad.\nWhen you buy an annuity, your pension pot is spent on an annual income that lasts for as long as you live. The longer you live, the better value for money it is.\nAs a result, insurance companies selling annuities are making a calculation or bet based on how much longer they think you will live. Smokers and those with health problems can get a better deal, owing to the shorter life expectancy.\nWhen you die the income generally ends, so cannot be claimed by your family.\nUnder the new rules, a pension pot can be taken as cash, become part of your estate, and be passed on to your children. However, unless it is invested in a way that avoids inheritance tax, it could push the assets left in a will over the ¬£325,000 threshold that means inheritance tax will be levied.\nMillions of people will still save for retirement in a pension organised by an insurance company. This company will have your money and will try to encourage you to use it to buy one of their products when you reach retirement.\nClearly, there is nothing wrong in that, although it might not give retirees a clear picture on whether it is a good deal. With lots of financial firms wanting to get hold of that money, there is a danger of a minority of them overstating what is being offered.\nThe sector is regulated, giving individuals the opportunity to challenge and win compensation if they are mis-sold a product.\nThe government is also making it a requirement that retirees receive some guidance from their pension company, but it is not clear whether this will be impartial or free.\nThe vast majority of annuity money is invested in bonds, which flows through to businesses.\nIf the annuities market were to collapse, then this would reduce this supply line of credit to companies, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston says.\nThat could make businesses more dependent on banks for credit once again.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Asking prices in the capital for these top-of-the-ladder properties fell by 8.7% over the past year, according to search site Rightmove. House prices grew much faster in eastern England and the West Midlands than in London, according to Zoopla.\nLondon's annual house price growth for 2016 (3.7%) was below the UK average of 4.5% for the first time since 2008, the Nationwide Building Society says.\nSo has the London bubble burst? Are bargains to be had? Well, these things are relative.\nOne new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for ¬£3.65m each.\nFor most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London.\nThe idea of downsizing to a ¬£3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are \"realistically priced\".\n\"They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point,\" she says. \"London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere.\"\nThis is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years.\nDespite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still ¬£474,000, more than double the typical price of ¬£217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes.\nSince April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than ¬£1.5m reaches 15%.\nThe surcharge led to a burst of activity in March followed by a steep drop in transactions in April - a \"hangover\" that still persists, according to Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).\nIn Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated.\nThe new surcharge, alongside a rise in normal stamp duty costs for ¬£1m-plus homes since 2014, had a bigger impact on the market than the Brexit vote in June, according to experts.\nRay Boulger, of John Charcol mortgage brokers, says it led to many at the expensive end of the market choosing to extend their homes rather than move. This made it more difficult to create chains lower down the market.\nEd Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, says the housing market recovered \"remarkably quickly\" after cooling immediately after the UK's vote to leave the EU.\nHe says a \"degree of nerves\" surrounding the economy and potential buyers' caution over stretching too far financially had kept a lid on house prices.\nAnother major factor in the market over the last 12 months, according to the experts, is a lack of homes going on to the market. This supply squeeze has meant that, despite all the other pressures on affordability, prices continued to increase.\nThe constraint on supply proved to be more problematic than expected, according to Mr Rubinsohn of Rics, whose prediction of a 6% rise in house prices for 2016 looks to be the most accurate.\nThis trend will continue, he says, spelling more difficulties for first-time buyers whose incomes may fall in real terms. Many will continue to rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad for help with raising a mortgage deposit, while others will look to the government's Help to Buy projects to find somewhere affordable.\nOthers see first-time buyers as key to the buoyancy of the housing market.\n\"First-time buyers still underpin the wider market. So long as the government continues to support them either directly via Help to Buy or by further tax changes then the market should not plunge but this is not completely in the gift of politicians who frankly have more pressing matters to attend to,\" says property buying agent Henry Pryor.\n\"Like last year if you already own a home then you are probably better off than someone who doesn't. If you don't, then it seems unlikely that 2017 will see a swift solution emerge.\"\nThe experts have a relatively wide spread of predictions for 2017 - from price falls overall to rises matching or outstripping the general level of inflation.\nMartin Ellis, housing economist at mortgage lender the Halifax, is offering a hedge-your-bets prediction of between a 1% and 4% rise.\n\"The relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for the UK economy next year,\" he says.\nGiven that a buying a home is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives, they - and their mortgage lender - will want some certainty over their job and income before taking the plunge.\nWhere can I afford to live?", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "We drive up the hills in his pickup truck to see farmers harvest the coffee beans in the vast valley around us.\nCoffee has been the economic backbone of this region - on the border between the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo - for more than a century.\nBut after years of a commodity-fuelled boom, economies like Brazil are having a hard time adjusting to slower global demand and lower prices.\nOver the decades, the Lacerda family has known fortune and poverty, with their wealth always oscillating around coffee. Droughts, government policies, global consumption, currency problems - these were blessings and curses that determined the fate of the Lacerdas.\nBut in the past five years, farmers in this region are finding new ways to make their own fortunes, trying to move away from producing cheap commodity beans and instead invest in top quality production.\nTarcisio drives me to the top of the hill and lets me in on their secret.\nThe valley is filled with coffee trees - but not all of it produces particularly good coffee. In the past, farmers would collect all beans, put them in bags and ship them abroad, getting whatever prices were listed in the commodity markets.\nNow Tarcisio and his family are separating the best beans - most of which are from trees 1,500 metres above sea level - and producing their own specialty brands. The rest is sold to the market as cheaper, unprocessed green beans.\n\"Usually you double your price - going from commodity to specialty,\" he says.\n\"A bag of commodity coffee is now worth 450 reais ($110; √Ç¬£72) - but we can sell specialty at around 900 or 1000 reais ($220 or $240),\" he says.\nTarcisio takes me to his neighbour's farm - Forquilha do Rio - which has been winning some of Brazil's top awards for coffee.\nTheir quality has to do with the favourable local conditions - mild temperatures, good sun exposure and high altitude.\n\"We knew our coffee was good, but we had no idea it was this good,\" says Afonso de Abreu Lacerda (no relation to Tarcisio), in front of a cabinet packed with trophies.\n\"It wasn't until we started competing in awards, about five years ago, that we learned just how valuable it was,\" he adds.\nIn 2012, when Forquilha do Rio won one of Brazil's top awards, they were able to sell one of their lots for $950 - more than six times the commodity price at the time. They are now exporting their finished brand to China and Japan.\nThe \"specialty revolution\" is partly the brainchild of Tarcisio's son, 26-year-old Jhone.\nWhen he was just 15, Jhone dropped out of school and moved into the family property, determined to learn everything about the coffee trade.\nWith each harvest, father and son experimented with different ways of harvesting, drying up and roasting their product.\nJhone designed, built and patented a new coffee drying equipment - which is one of the crucial elements of turning commodity beans into gourmet food.\nHe also became a licensed Q-Grader - a special category of coffee tasters.\nThey started developing their own brand - Fazenda Santa Rita - after buying roasters, and now have their own packages.\n\"This change in direction is something that the markets imposed on us,\" says Jhone Lacerda.\n\"We used to depend on the price of commodities - on things like how much coffee other countries are drinking, or whether they are in crisis or not,\" he tells me.\n\"We want to be in a smaller market, but that does not depend just on demand. In the specialty market, it is not the global demand that drives prices. It is the quality of the product that you put out.\"\nJhone uses his Q-Grader skills to advise all producers in the region on what price to charge for their harvests.\nTogether with two other families, he created the Montanhas do Caparao, a blend of some of the region's best coffees that has also won a top prize in Brazil.\nJhone is now back in school, studying coffee production at Instituto Federal do Esp√É¬≠rito Santo college.\nJhone's father tells me it took centuries for Brazil to finally wake up and smell its own specialty coffee. His parents had never thought of it before.\nBrazil is the world's top producer and exporter of coffee by a large margin. It makes about a third of the world's coffee - but virtually all of it is green beans of very low aggregate value.\nIn the commodity market, the price for green coffee beans depends on factors such as climate and global consumption.\nBut other types of commodities - like soybeans and iron ore - are now suffering from the slowdown of the Chinese economy.\nAs Brazil and Latin America rely heavily on commodities and Chinese consumption, the whole region is slowing down to the tune of those markets. Brazil's economy is expected to contract more than 2% this year.\nThe head of the foreign relations department in Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Alberto Coelho Fonseca, says producers in many different areas are now trying to add value to food by exporting refined products, which is a way to compensate for lower international prices.\n\"A specialty coffee can be sold at 300% more value than a non-specialty coffee,\" he says.\n\"Even if they have a very small share in exports, the techniques of producing good specialty coffee can spread value through the chain.\"\nNow some government officials want to help these premium brands take off abroad.\nIn next year's Rio Olympics, Brazil will serve its specialty coffee in tourism lounges in all venues.\nMr Fronseca adds: \"About 70% of the coffee brewed by coffeehouses like Starbuck, Cafe Nero or Costa is likely to be from Brazil. We need to showcases our products better.\"\nBack in the Caparao Mountains, local producers found another way to add value to their product - tourism.\nLocal farms opened up special cafes and hostels, where visitors are taken on coffee-tasting tours, modelled on California's wine-producing Napa valley.\nThis is still in its infancy, but it helps consolidate the region's reputation for quality blends.\nNow, say Jhone and Tarcisio Lacerda, half of the beans in their farms are already being used to produce their specialty roast, and they have big plans.\nJhone says: \"We want to produce the best coffee in the world.\n\"We want the Caparao region to become well-known across the world.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "It would also diminish President Trump's ability to dismiss sanctions against Russia.\nAfter Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, in 2014, the Obama administration in tandem with the European Union introduced an array of economic sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses.\nMany of the individuals targeted were linked to Russia's actions in Ukraine or were part of President Vladimir Putin's elite entourage.\nAssets were frozen and restrictions imposed on Russia's oil industry, as well as its state finance, technology and arms sectors.\nIn December 2016, Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Russian compounds in response to what the US intelligence community concluded was a Russian government-backed cyber-attack directed to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Moscow denies the allegation.\nMembers of the US Congress want to turn existing sanctions, and some new ones, into law.  Both houses have Republican majorities, the same party as the president.\nSenators overwhelmingly backed the  bill earlier in June, with only two opposing votes, and it now requires a successful vote in the House of Representatives. It will then go back to the Senate for approval before going to the White House. The new bill also targets Iran and is expected to include North Korea.\nPresident Trump will either sign it into law or reject it with use of a veto. With enough votes, Congress could use its own veto to counter the president.\nThe bill tightens existing sanctions around the ongoing situation in Ukraine and imposes new measures including some in response to alleged hacking during the 2016 election and others that target key Russian industries such as the railways, shipping, metals and mining. It would also bring in restrictions on companies doing business with the Russian oil industry.\nIt means getting rid of sanctions will become much harder, and the power to reverse the sanctions effectively moves from the hands of the president to Congress. Previously, the sanctions were introduced as executive orders, which any president has the power to remove instantly.\nUnder the proposed law, Congress must approve any request from the president to ease the financial penalties detailed in the bill.  In order to waive individual sanctions, a president would need to submit a report to Congress outlining why it is in the national interest to take that action.\nThe White House says it supports the sanctions legislation. A presidential veto would provoke \"a major outcry\" among politicians in Washington, wrote Steven Pifer for Brookings, a foreign policy think tank.\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, signalled the White House's support for tough sanctions on Russia until the situation in Ukraine was \"fully resolved\". Without a clear end in sight, that could mean a long time.\nJames Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, a foreign policy think tank, says Russia has so far given the president the benefit of the doubt when it comes to Mr Trump's promise to forge better relations between Washington and Moscow. However, these new sanctions may \"test their faith\" because they are in fact harsher than the sanctions under President Obama.\nThe law signals a departure from a joint EU-US approach to Russian sanctions. And some European countries have economic concerns because the new law could penalise European companies that invest in big Russian infrastructure projects such as the new Nord Stream II pipeline to transport gas between Russia and Germany.\nThe German Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said this part of the new sanctions programme would add a new negative dimension to US-European relations and Europe's energy supplies were \"a matter for Europe, not for the United States\".\nGermany is said to be pushing for EU sanctions against Russia to be stepped up, according to diplomatic sources quoted in Brussels.\nThe government in Berlin is said to want four Russian nationals and businesses added to the European bloc's sanctions list after it was revealed gas turbines made by  German technology firm Siemens were illegally shipped to Crimea.  Siemens said it had \"credible information\" that its equipment had been diverted from its original destination.

These people often need support once they leave and the numbers show there are increasing delays in arranging that.\nThe extra money was meant to ease these two problems in particular, but there is little to suggest that has happened.\nThe worry now is that hospitals get clogged up and pressures continue to build.\nNHS England chief operating officer Dame Barbara Hakin said it was \"disappointing\" performance had dropped, but said last week was the busiest so far this winter with more than 415,000 people attending A&E, while the numbers that needing admitting to hospital for further treatment - emergency admissions - hit its highest level since 2010.\nShe added: \"We know the A&E standard is ambitious and that is only right.  This is the first week since April the 95% standard has not been met, however we do know that sometimes this will happen.\n\"Every year we see a dip in the figures for December, with week on week variations which is why we fully assess how local systems are coping with winter pressures over a longer period.\n\"We knew this winter would be difficult but it is important to stress the NHS continues to deliver a good service. This is thanks to the hard work and dedication of our frontline staff.\"\nThe drop in performance comes despite the government giving the NHS extra money to cope with winter - √Ç¬£250m was announced in the summer and another √Ç¬£150m was pledged last month.\nA Department of Health spokeswoman added: \"We have always been clear that this could be a difficult winter - and there could be more difficult weeks ahead.

The following day, the child's parents received a letter that said: \"Your son is dead, I have been avenged.\"\nThe next month, a cousin of the boy's father, Bernard Laroche, was arrested when his sister-in-law, Muriel Bolle, testified against him. He was released in 1985 when she retracted her statement, but shot dead by Jean-Marie Villemin, the boy's father, weeks later.\nThe father went to jail for Laroche's murder for several years. The boy's mother, Christine Villemin, was also jailed for her son's murder but later cleared. Both were later given compensation by the state for miscarriage of justice.\nThe anonymous phone-calls and poison-pen letters continued over the years, and the case was reopened first in 2000 and then again in 2008 in an attempt to identify the DNA on the letters. Three separate traces of DNA were found but not identified.\nLittle news has been heard in the \"Gr√©gory affair\" since police said in 2013 that DNA tests had brought the investigation no further.\nThat was until about 08:00 (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday, when investigators from Dijon detained a couple in their 70s in the village of Aumontzey, in the Vologne river valley. Sources told French media that they were the father's uncle and aunt.\nThey were placed in police custody on suspicion of complicity in the murder, failing to report a crime or helping a person at risk, according to L'Est R√©publicain website.\nA third person reported to be the father's half-sister was also being held. A fourth, said to be the victim's grandmother, was taken in as a witness. Her husband was also questioned.\nProsecutor Jean-Jacques Bosc said investigators had targeted \"people very close to the heart of this case\" and hoped to provide answers to the questions they had.\nLocal reporters covering the case pointed out that none of those held on Wednesday was suspected of the boy's murder.\nThey also said that Muriel Bolle, who as a teenager had initially blamed the killing on Bernard Laroche, had been asked to provide a DNA sample on Wednesday before later being released.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,\" Ms Ruane said.\nHowever, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.\nSDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that \"there is no such definition\" as fatal foetal abnormality.\nSpeaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.\nMs Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be \"reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her\".\nHowever, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  \"charter for abortion on demand\".\nHe said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that \"95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?\"\n\"All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,\" he said.\nMr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through \"due process\" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.\nDUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.\n\"I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,\" she said.\n\"The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.\"\nAt the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the \"sense of dignity\" they displayed during the discussions.\nStormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\nPrecious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to \"expose\" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.\nAmnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a \"betrayal of women\", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The terror attacks that traumatised this small nation have dominated political life and the media in Norway ever since.\nNorwegians are weary of the wall-to-wall media coverage of the Breivik attacks but they are still searching for answers about what happened that day. In particular, the victims' families want to know why it took police so long to respond.\nThe former justice minister Knut Storberget and the former chief of security services (PST) Janne Kristiansen, both in charge at the time, were forced to resign under heavy criticism of the handling of the terror attacks.\nAfter months of criticism, the police, the PST and Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg finally apologised in March.\nThe catalogue of police errors on the day is currently under investigation and will be a main subject of the independent public inquiry into the attacks which is due to be published in August.\nOslo District Court has built a new, custom-made courtroom (no 250) for Breivik's trial, and refurbished two floors to accommodate the media and the many aggrieved parties who will be following the trial. Geir Engebretsen, president of the court, says the trial is estimated to cost around √Ç¬£10m (12.1m euros; $15.9m).\nHe expects there to be between 1,000-1,400 people in the court building every day during the trial, however there are only 190 places available in the main courtroom which are reserved for the victims and members of the press.\nAn estimated 2,500 people will be able to follow the trial via video link in 18 local courts around the country.\nThe police have the responsibility of securing the building and have promised that everyone will feel safe. Breivik himself will be protected in court by a bulletproof screen. He has received at least two confirmed death threats in prison.\nThe case will be heard by a panel of five judges rather than a jury: two professional judges and three lay judges who are general members of the public.\nThe accused: Anders Behring Breivik (33)\nJudges: Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen, Arne Lyng\nLay Judges: Ernst Henning Eielsen, Thomas Indreboe, Diana Patricia Fynbo\nPublic Prosecutors: Inga Bejer Engh and Svein Holden\nCounsel for the Defence: Geir Lippestad, Tord Jordet, Odd Ivar Groen, Vibeke Hein Baera\nCo-ordinating Counsel for the aggrieved parties: Mette Yvonne Larsen, Siv Hallgren, Frode Elgesem\nExpert witnesses: Torgeir Husby, Synne Soerheim, Agnar Aspaas, Terje Toerrisen\nThe trial is expected to finish on 22 June. The verdict, due some weeks later, can be appealed.\nThe trial will begin with the indictment read out by the prosecution. Breivik is expected to take the stand on Tuesday 17 April and will have several days to testify.\nWhile the prosecution will call more than 90 witnesses, Breivik's lawyers will summon up to 40.\nControversially, his defence counsel has notified the court it will call a number of far right extremists including a prolific Norwegian blogger, known as Fjordman, whom Breivik quoted extensively in his manifesto.\nThey will also call members of the Labour Party and Progress Party, as well as writers and experts on terrorism and psychiatry. Several public figures have said they will refuse to appear.\nBreivik's defence counsel Geir Lippestad has taken the unusual step of warning the nation that what his client is likely to say in court will be offensive and shocking.  Breivik is proud of what he has done and has instructed his counsel to tell the press: \"I am not sorry and I would do the same thing all over again.\"\nMany of Breivik's victims hope that through this lengthy judicial process all aspects of Norway's dark Friday will be revealed and they will get the answers they need.\nBjoern Ihler, 20, who survived the massacre on Utoeya and took care of two children aged eight and nine during the ordeal, has been called to testify during the trial. He told the BBC that he was ready to face Breivik and that he had accepted he would have to live with what happened for the rest of his life. \"But I don't want Norway to change because of what Breivik did; we need to get back to who we were before the 22nd of July.\"\nMette Yvonne Larsen, coordinating counsel for the aggrieved parties, says that the questions surrounding Breivik's sanity are key for her clients. \"Most of them do not believe he is insane - they were there, they looked him in the eye, they watched him calmly walk around the island shooting.\"\nTwo major psychiatric reports ordered by the court have come up with opposite conclusions. The first report back in November (243 pages) concluded that Breivik was a paranoid schizophrenic and was psychotic at the time of the crime. The second report (319 pages), published a few days ago, concluded that Breivik was sane and showed no signs of psychosis.\nThis question will be at the heart of the trial: whether Breivik is criminally insane or sane. Extraordinarily, the defence counsel agrees with the victims' families that Breivik is sane. The prosecution asserts that he is criminally insane. In criminal trials it is usually the other way around.\nBreivik has sent a 36-page letter to members of the press criticising the forensic psychiatrists Synne Soerheim and Torgeir Husby who carried out the first report, claiming that 80% of what they wrote was made up.\nHe writes: \"Being declared insane would be a fate worse than death.\" His lawyers have told the BBC that, for him, the most important aim of the trial is that the court finds him sane.\nBreivik sees himself as a political activist and a soldier on a mission to save Norway and Europe from being taken over by Islam. Being declared insane would be a blow to his perceived credibility. That is why Breivik wants a prison sentence rather than a compulsory mental health care order.\nThe survivors and victims' families want answers and hope that at the end of the trial he will disappear from the public space to allow the healing to begin.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It would be the biggest single change to Wales' electoral map since the Boundary Commission was created in 1944.\nScotland, which will announce detailed proposals next month, would change from 59 seats to 53.\nNorthern Ireland has already unveiled its plans which see its constituencies reduce from 18 to 17.\nIn England, all but 68 of the current 533 constituencies will see some change with 33 being abolished entirely.\nThe Isle of Wight will become two constituencies meaning that the net reduction in seats is 32.\nSome of the changes are minor with single wards swapping constituency or boundaries simply becoming aligned with local authority divisions.\nThe North West loses seven constituencies and 14 of the current 75 remain unchanged.\nThe West Midlands loses six constituencies and seven remain unchanged.\nLondon loses five constituencies - so will end up with 68 rather than 73.

Hold on a minute, did someone say introverted?\n\"I've got this reputation of being confident, yet I go and do all these psychology tests and I'm an introvert,\" Pietersen tells his former team-mate Andrew Flintoff in an interview to be aired on BBC Radio 5 live on Tuesday at 20:30 BST.\nSource: ESPN Cricinfo\n\"I'm very much an introverted person. I like my own company, my own family. I don't really go out much.\n\"I think the confidence has grown from what I've achieved on the cricket field but I'm not as confident as anybody thinks.\"\nThe disarming revelation is one of many in Pietersen's fascinating chat with Flintoff, a player with whom he occasionally clashed during the years they shared an England dressing room.\nIn it, Pietersen talks about growing up in South Africa unaware of what the Ashes were, his see-saw relationship with Shane Warne, his ill-fated spell as captain and his regret over the silly shots that have left him looking \"a complete mug\" at times.\nHe opens up about England captains past and present, relives the anguish of injuries and loss of form and reaffirms his ambition to clock up 10,000 Test runs.\nLike many top sportsmen, Pietersen is public property, someone we think we know much better than we actually do.\nThis interview goes behind the bling and the bravado to reveal an insecurity over his image, a recognition of his faults, a light-heartedness - he calls Flintoff \"chubby\" at one point - and perhaps less surprisingly, an absolute obsession with his performance on the field of play.\nAfter leaving South Africa in protest against the racial quota system - which insisted on a certain number of non-white players in every team - and qualifying to play for England through the Kolpak rule, Pietersen announced himself with three one-day centuries against the country of his birth in early 2005.\nHe went on to play a decisive role in England's historic Ashes victory over Australia later that year, making back-to-back fifties on his Test debut at Lord's and sealing the series with a breathtaking 158 at The Oval.\nThe sheer audacity with which Pietersen took on the team that had dominated the game for more than a decade was jaw-dropping, but as he reveals to Flintoff, his close relationship with Australian talisman Warne - they were team-mates at Hampshire - was one of the major reasons why he settled so quickly into Ashes cricket.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Having the great Shane Warne as my mate, walking onto the field and not having him hammer me from first slip, but just laugh and have a joke helped a lot,\" says Pietersen.\n\"I think I could have been fearful playing Australia but because this huge figure was a mate of mine, it calmed things down.\"\nThere was nothing calm about the celebrations that followed England's Ashes win as the players famously partied the night away before arriving at a Downing Street reception the next morning somewhat the worse for wear.\nOne photograph shows a sozzled-looking Flintoff and Pietersen arm in arm outside Number 10, the former with eyelids sagging over reddened pupils and the latter looking bedraggled with a loose tie, sunglasses and a haircut which he jokingly refers to as \"the skunk\".\nAs they reminisce over the mayhem, Pietersen is less certain than Flintoff that he would do the same again.\n\"The reason I don't enjoy [looking back] is that I can't remember it,\" he says.\n\"We probably deserved it because we had just beaten Australia and I think winning series like that need to be enjoyed but I also remember beating Australia in Australia and winning the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean and thinking 'do you know what, just enjoy it, just walk around and take it in'.\nJuly\n10-14 1st Test, Trent Bridge (11:00 BST)\n18-22 2nd Test, Lord's (11:00 BST)\nAugust\n1-5 3rd Test, Old Trafford (11:00 BST)\n9-13 4th Test, Chester-le-Street (11:00 BST)\n21-25 5th Test, The Oval (11:00 BST)\n29 1st Twenty20 international, Southampton (18:30 BST)\n31 2nd Twenty20 international, Chester-le-Street (14:30 BST)\nSeptember\n6 1st ODI, Headingley (10:15 BST)\n8 2nd ODI, Old Trafford (10:15 BST)\n11 3rd ODI, Edgbaston (14:00 BST)\n14 4th ODI, Cardiff (10:15 BST)\n16 5th ODI, Southampton (14:00 BST)\nNB Fixtures and start times are subject to change.

In 2005 the emotions took over and we ended up all over the place that evening, but I haven't done it that way since.\"\nAfter the boozing came the backlash, and the painful memory for both players of the 5-0 whitewash by Australia in the return Ashes series down under. With Warne now very much foe not friend, and Flintoff struggling with the demands of captaincy, England were blown away.\n\"When Australia were looking at what had gone wrong in 2005 one of the things they put it down to was Warne's relationship with me and they said that had to change,\" says Pietersen, 33.\n\"He threw the ball twice at me in Brisbane and our discussions got really, really personal in the middle. Off the field he called me Kevin, not KP or PK. It had totally changed.\"\nDespite the provocation from Warne, Pietersen enjoyed a prolific series with the bat, averaging more than 54. His reaction to the defeat, however, hinted at the friction with his team-mates that flared up so spectacularly last year.\n\"I was extremely disappointed - I didn't deal with it the right way,\" he admits.\n\"I don't think I related to it in Australia - because I got 500 runs and I was thinking 'why did we get smashed?' I don't think that went down well with some people.\"\nIn one of the most introspective sections of the interview, Pietersen explains that he learnt to deal with the failings of his team-mates when he was going through a bad patch of his own in 2010.\n\"Until you go through the depths of despair as a sportsman you don't understand the good stuff or the bad stuff,\" he says.\n\"The hardest time was on a Bangladesh tour in 2010. I didn't know which end of the bat to hold. I just couldn't hit the ball and I ended up sitting on a bus and thinking 'where is my career going to go?'\"\nFortunately for England, a spell in South Africa with his mentor Graham Ford soon put things right and set Pietersen up for one of the most prolific periods of his career.\nThere was a double-hundred in Adelaide in England's 3-1 Ashes triumph in 2010-11, another at Lord's in the 4-0 whitewash of India in 2011, and four more hundreds before a knee injury sidelined him in March.\nThey included the defiant 149 against South Africa at Headingley last year, before the discovery of his \"provocative\" text messages to the opposition dressing room saw him dropped for the final Test at Lord's, and the brilliant 186 against India in Mumbai that confirmed his \"reintegration\" into the England side.\nThat century was Pietersen's 22nd in Tests, briefly taking him alongside Wally Hammond, Colin Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott and current captain Alastair Cook at the top of England's all-time list.\nPietersen describes the less extravagant but more consistent Cook - who has since taken his own tally of tons to 25 - as \"such a nice guy\" who will go down as \"one of the greatest cricketers in terms of statistics to have ever played the game\".\nAs for his own legacy, in a closing passage to the interview tinged with regret, he concedes that his tendency towards showmanship may leave him short of his ultimate ambitions.\n\"I've always said I just want to get the best out of my talent and when I've finished my career I just want to say I've done the best that I possibly could,\" he explains.\n\"But I know that because of the way I play I'm not going to have done the best I could because I get myself out for 20, 40, 60 or 70 all the time.

I love the patients and I feel, with my experience, I've got a lot to offer.\"\nThe NHS is reviewing employment for older workers, but Anne does not believe they are denying openings to the next generation.\n\"We're saying 'yes we can do it. We're mature, we're old but we're not written off.\"\nThere are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60.\nBut better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead.\nNot everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though.\nFor Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss.  But for big employers, it's not so simple.\nThe NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers.\nIn England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday.\nIt's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages.\nBut would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions.\nThe government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048.\nAs a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates.\nBut many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload.\nHe loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire.\n\"I do need the money,\" he says. \"If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough.\"\nThe self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do.\nMany of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want.\nBut if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them.\nSource: ONS/NHS\nThere are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want.\nAnd in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers  after the state retirement age was abolished.\nBut older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old.\nAnd many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years.\nIt's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher.\nAnd if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker.\nFor many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The research found that catastrophic collisions would likely occur every five to nine years at the altitudes used principally to observe the Earth.\nAnd the scientists who did the work say their results are optimistic - the real outcome would probably be far worse.\nTo date, there have been just a handful of major collisions in the space age.\nThe study was conducted for the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee.\nThis is the global forum through which world governments discuss the issue of \"space junk\" - abandoned rocket stages, defunct satellites and their exploded fragments.\nThe space agencies of Europe, the US, Italy, the UK, Japan and India all contributed to the latest research, each one using their own experts and methodology to model the future space environment.\nThey were most concerned with low-Earth orbit (that is, below 2,000km in altitude).  This is where the majority of missions returning critical Earth-observation data tend to operate.\nAll six modelling groups came out with broadly the same finding - a steady increase in the numbers of objects 10cm and bigger over the 200-year period.\nThis growth was driven mostly by collisions between objects at altitudes between 700km and 1,000km.\nThe low-end projection was for a 19% increase; the high-end forecast was for a 36% rise. Taken together, the growth was 30%.  These are averages of hundreds of simulations.\nFor the cumulative number of catastrophic collisions over the period, the range went from just over 20 to just under 40.\nSomewhat worryingly, the forecasting work made some optimistic assumptions.\nOne was a 90% compliance with the \"25-year rule\". This is a best-practice time-limit adopted by the world's space agencies for the removal of their equipment from orbit once it has completed its mission.\nThe other was the idea that there would be no more explosions from half-empty fuel and pressure tanks, and from old batteries - a significant cause of debris fragments to date.\n\"We're certainly not at 90% compliance with the 25-year rule yet, and we see explosion events on average about three times a year,\" explained Dr Hugh Lewis, who detailed the research findings at the 6th European Conference on Space Debris in Darmstadt, Germany, on Monday.\n\"It is fair to say this is an optimistic look forward, and the situation will be worse than what we presented in the study,\" the UK Space Agency delegate to the IADC told BBC News.\n\"So one message from our study is that we need to do better with these debris-mitigation measures, but even with that we need to consider other approaches as well. One of the options obviously is active debris removal.\"\nResearch groups around the world are devising strategies to catch old rocket bodies and satellites, to pull them out of orbit.\nPrevious modelling work has indicated that removing just a few key items each year could have a significant limiting effect on the growth of debris.\nMost ideas include attaching a propulsion module to a redundant body, perhaps via a hook or robotic clamp.\nOne UK concept under development is a harpoon. This would be fired at the hapless target from close range.\nA propulsion pack tethered to the projectile would then tug the junk downwards, to burn up in the atmosphere.\nWhen the BBC first reported this concept back in October, the harpoon was being test-fired over a short range of just 2m.\nThe latest testing, to be reported at the Darmstadt conference this week, has seen the harpoon fired over a much longer distance and at a more realistic, rotating target.\n\"Our tests have progressed really well, and everything seems to be scaling as expected,\" explained Dr Jaime Reed, from Astrium UK.\n\"We've now upgraded to a much more powerful gun and have been firing the harpoon over 10m - the sort of distance we'd expect to have to cover on a real debris-removal mission.\n\"Our harpoon also now has a shock absorber on it to make sure it doesn't go too far inside the satellite, and we've been firing it with the tether attached.  It's very stable in flight.\"\nThere are some 20,000 man-made objects in orbit that are currently being monitored regularly. About two-thirds of this population is in Low-Earth orbit.\nThese are just the big, easy-to-see items, however. Moving around unseen are an estimated 500,000 particles ranging in size between 1-10cm across, and perhaps tens of millions of other particles smaller than 1cm.\nAll of this material is travelling at several kilometres per second - sufficient velocity for even the smallest fragment to become a damaging projectile if it strikes an operational space mission.\nTwo key events have added significantly to the debris problem in recent years.\nThe first was the destructive anti-satellite test conducted by the Chinese in 2007 on one of their own retired weather spacecraft.\nThe other, in 2009, was the collision between the Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33 satellites.\nTaken together, these two events essentially negated all the mitigation gains that had been made over the previous 20 years to reduce junk production from spent rocket explosions.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nFive weeks have passed since the 35-year-old was sacked, with the team eighth in the Championship.\nScot Neil believes the squad was good enough to return to the top flight, but with the benefit of hindsight admits his mistake.\n\"We had a lot of players at the club for longer than five years, and we needed to start afresh,\" Neil said.\n\"Thirteen of the 24 players in the first-team squad were over 30, and when we went up the last time they were 28, which is significantly different, it's when you're at your peak.\n\"We needed to re-build and the one thing I blame myself for is that I re-signed all the players to get us back up because they'd done it in the past. I should have taken more time and looked to alter the squad at that stage.\"\nNeil makes no concession to self-pity. He admits himself that while he was manager of Hamilton Academical in the Scottish Premiership, nobody would have predicted his move to Norwich, or then immediately guiding them to promotion to the Premier League.\nAt 33, he became the second youngest manager in the Championship, working with some players who were older than him, and plenty who had performed at a higher level. Neil, though, was typically unfazed.\nHe recalls his first words to the squad being to urge them to do better. The players's recollection is that it was more of a blunt ultimatum - shape up or ship out.\nResults were immediate, with 17 wins from the remaining 25 games, including an unbeaten run of 13 away games, and then promotion via the play-offs.\nIpswich were dispatched in the semi-final, after Neil assured his players their opponents would run out of steam in the second leg at Carrow Road because they played at such a high intensity. Norwich scored twice in the second half and then defeated Middlesbrough in the final after Neil told his players that their opponents had only come back from conceding the opening goal once in four years. Norwich scored first.\nThe reward was a windfall for the club, and a rise in status for the manager, but his job only became more challenging.\n\"People think you get ¬£130m put in your bank account the next day, but that's not the case,\" Neil said.\n\"That money's broken down over the whole season. Norwich are self-sustaining and don't have anybody who invests. So my first signings were the first week in August, because the [play-off] money didn't drop until August.\"\nNeil was capable of moments of audacity, such as guiding his team to a 2-1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but of the three promoted sides they invested the least amount ahead of the campaign and ended up dropping back down to the Championship, while Bournemouth and Watford remained in the Premier League.\nNeil believed he could return Norwich to the top flight and won eight of the opening 12 games this season. He suffered a run of six league games without a win in October and another run of five games without a victory in the run-up to his departure.\n\"It was a strange and difficult time for us,\" Neil told BBC Scotland.\n\"The away form was always poor, but our home form was relatively good. We beat Nottingham Forest by five, Brentford by five - they've just beaten Reading by seven - so they were always capable.\n\"We didn't have enough consistency. This group has more technical quality than the last group, but I'm not sure it's as resilient.\n\"I wouldn't say I was harshly treated. When you don't win games, your position is going to come under question. Looking at the squad, were we good enough to get ourselves up? Yeah, I would say we were.\n\"[Major shareholder] Delia [Smith] wasn't the one who told me I was no longer required. I spoke to [chairman] Ed Balls and Steve Stone, and I requested to go and speak to Delia in the boardroom upstairs, and I thanked her for everything she'd done and the opportunity, because it was a gamble.\n\"I've got no ill feelings towards anybody. I had plans to take it forward and my only frustration is that I've not had the opportunity to see that through.\"\nNeil won two promotions in four years, at Hamilton then Norwich, and believes his achievements are worthy of another opportunity in England. He has no plans to return to Scottish football, and admits the game he left behind is not highly thought of in England.\n\"It was like that when I was a player and it's just as bad now,\" Neil said.\n\"Even talking about scouting Scotland, they say, 'don't even bother', they won't come up and look at the talent. The English game regards itself as far and away beyond the Scottish game.\n\"It might be right in a sense off the field, but there are players in Scotland who can go down to England and do really well. Two of the lads I played with are a case in point - [James] McCarthy and [James] McArthur have done exceptionally well.\n\"There's no reason, given the right backing that some other kids could do the same.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The wall at Oxgangs Primary collapsed during stormy weather in January 2016.\nA senior employee at the subcontractor that built it, VB Contracts, told the BBC the inner and outer walls were not constructed at the same time.\nArchitecture professor Alan Dunlop said this \"design issue\" could have been the root of the problem at Oxgangs.\nVB Contracts went bust in 2010, but the BBC spoke to a former employee, who did not want to be identified, as part of the BBC Scotland Investigates: How Safe is My School? programme, which was broadcast on Monday evening.\nThe collapse of the Oxgangs wall led to 17 schools across Edinburgh being closed over safety concerns. They have all since reopened.\nThe schools had all been built or refurbished following a √Ç¬£360m deal between the city council and a private finance consortium under the Public Private Partnership 1 (PPP1) scheme.\nThe lead contractor for the Edinburgh schools project, Miller Construction, was bought by Galliford Try in 2014.\nMiller Construction had outsourced some of the work to VB Contracts, which was responsible for the brick and blockworks at Oxgangs Primary, and built the wall that collapsed.\nInternal blockworks for such walls are generally built at the same time as the brick which forms the outside skin of the building.\nThis allows the builder to ensure the two parts are properly connected, with wall ties in the right places.\nBut the former employee said Miller Construction had told VB Contracts to build the internal wall at Oxgangs first so the building could be made water and wind tight as quickly as possible in order to allow inside work such as plastering to get started.\nIt was the outer wall that subsequently fell down at Oxgangs school.\nArchitect Alan Dunlop told the BBC the way the walls were built was therefore not \"standard practice\" and in his view was at the \"root of the problems\" at Oxgangs school.\nHe said: \"If you're going to do that, I would expect a method statement for that to be done. That's a design issue. It's not an add, it's not something you do ad hoc. And you have to do it properly and you have to specify the right wall ties for doing it.\n\"In the evidence of the photographs that we have seen, that doesn't look to be the proper wall tie that you would actually use in circumstances like that.\"\nMr Dunlop added: \"The evidence is clear in the Oxgangs project. The wall collapsed and evidently it doesn't look as though it was safe at all. That's another whole shocking and worrying aspect of this whole process.\"\nIn a statement, Galliford Try said it had contractual responsibility for four of the 17 Edinburgh public private partnership schools built 10 years ago.\nThe statement added: \"Work required to reopen those four schools temporarily closed has been completed and the schools opened on 24 May and 6 June 2016.\n\"Throughout, Galliford Try's priority has been to ensure the children return to their studies at the earliest opportunity. We worked tirelessly with the City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Schools Partnership in order to achieve this.\"\nAn independent inquiry into the school closures matter will consider whether the private finance method used to construct them contributed to the structural issues with the buildings.\nThe City of Edinburgh Council said the schools would be safe and well-maintained for as long as the contract is in place.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Coral \"bleaching\" has led to widespread coral decline and habitat loss on the world's largest coral reef system.\nSurveys show that 29% of corals died in 2016, greater than the  figure of 22% projected in mid-2016.\nThe worst-hit area was near Port Douglas, where 70% of shallow water corals died, but there was a recovery of corals in the south of the reef.\nThe latest results come from surveys carried out by the Marine Park Authority, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Australian Institute of Marine Science and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\nGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chairman Russell Reichelt said: \"As has been the case with reefs across the world, the Great Barrier Reef has experienced significant and widespread impacts over the last two years.\n\"We're very concerned about what this means for the Great Barrier Reef itself and what it means for the communities and industries that depend on it.\"\nAccording to newpaper reports, a meeting over the reef's future was recently told that the federal and Queensland government's long-term plan to protect the reef, announced in 2015, was no longer achievable.\nBleaching occurs when the algae living on coral is expelled due to stress caused by extreme, sustained changes in temperature. This turns the coral white.\nIn 2017, further coral die-offs are expected from the second year of bleaching in a row, and the impacts of tropical cyclone Debbie, the officials said.\nResearchers say that climate change is a significant driver behind the coral loss and experts have said the window is closing fast to cut the greenhouse gas emissions pushing up temperatures and harming the reef.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "\"Drones are arguably the most hyped product at CES,\" said Ben Wood, from analyst firm CCS Insight.\n\"A veritable minefield in terms of regulation and safety but as prices tumble expect to see them in a lot more Christmas stockings this year.\"\nThe Consumer Electronics Association, which organises CES, said the drone market should be worth about $130m (√Ç¬£86m) in 2015 - 50% higher than 2014.\nIn a few years the trade group expects it to be a billion-dollar market.\nBut not all is stable in the world of drones. Two key issues are dogging the field - regulation and power.\nIn the US the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has very strict rules around their commercial use.\nJim Williams, manager of the FAA's integration office, said its regulations for commercial use were strict for good reasons.\n\"People who are being paid to do a job are more likely to take risks to accomplish that,\" he said.\nAway from commercial use, there is much anxiety around the world about amateur drones and privacy, as most of the craft come equipped with cameras.\nThe second big worry is battery life.\nI spoke to several drone companies at CES representing both budget and high-end Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and the average battery life for the craft is about 20 minutes - with some managing just 10 minutes of flight time. One firm claims its devices have a flight time of about 50 minutes.\n\"One of the biggest frustrations with drones is battery life,\" said Mr Wood.\n\"It's rare to get more than 15 minutes of use and there seems little prospect of that improving any time soon.\n\"For prolonged usage, owners are typically obliged to get additional batteries, which means added cost.\"\nDespite the challenges, drones seem here to stay, and those on show at CES are a good sampling of the current state of the market.\nHexo+ raised $1.3m on Kickstarter to fund its UAV - a drone that will fly up to 60m (200ft) above your head and circle around you, giving you an all-round aerial selfie.\nIt has a flight time of 15 minutes and will eventually retail for $1,500. It can self-fly, but will auto-land if it goes out of range of your phone.\n\"You need zero skill,\" said shareholder Lug Giroud.\n\"In our selfie culture, everyone wants amazing shots of themselves. We want to give users great images.\"\nEHang has decided to court the female market by making a version of its popular Ghost drone available in pink. It works for some, apparently.\n\"Most people think drones are only for males,\" said Kai Jianes, of Ehang. \"But we are finding many female climbers and surfers want to use them to take video while they exercise.\"\nWhether they want to take that video with something luminous pink remains to be seen. But Ehang's black Ghost, in traditional quadcopter formation, had already become its bestseller, said Mr Jianes.\n\"The quadcopter format has become mainstream, it's so stable,\" he said. \"It doesn't require space to take off and, it's more energy efficient.\"\nThe batteries in the Ghost last 30 minutes, while Ehang's premium drone, the Skyway, manages 50 minutes.\nThe difference in time is reflected in the cost.\nThe Skyway costs $5,000 compared with a starting price of $375 for the Ghost without the attachment needed to hold a camera.\nThe X3, by Hubsan, is small enough to sit in your palm.\nWhat's it for?\n\"This is how we scare our friends,\" said a company representative.\n\"It's an office toy - just a cool gadget,\" they said. \"It was our most popular Christmas item from last year.\"\nAt $200 it's quite an expensive office toy especially as it can only manage 10 minutes of flying time before needing a recharge.\nAnd despite its tiny proportions, it is not the smallest on the market.\nHubsan itself makes a finger-sized model that has no camera. And Intel boss Brian Krzanich showed off the Nixie, a drone that wraps around your wrist, during his CES keynote speech.\nDJI unveiled a novel solution to the current regulatory issues facing drones - it has made a stick to which you can attach your drone camera when you're unable to use the drone itself.\nIt is fitted with stabilisers so the camera can either stay fixed while the stick moves, or follow the movement, with your smartphone acting as a viewfinder.\nIt's still a prototype at this stage and will accommodate both DJI's own camera and the drone flyer's favourite, the Go Pro.\n\"We are producing our own camera, but the audience just loves Go Pro,\" said Michael Shabun, of DJI.\nImprovements to basic drone technology were also on show at CES.\nQualcomm has produced a circuit board based around its Snapdragon chip, specifically for drones, that will enable them to perceive depth.\nTwo smartphone cameras at the front of the board enabled the device to build up a 3D image of its surroundings, giving it \"machine vision\", said Gary McGrath, of Qualcomm.\n\"It's for UAVs to figure out where they're at and control their motors - it'll help quadcopters fly without a control,\" he said.\nHere at CES, there's a drone for every occasion.\nThe headache for the regulators is going to be working out how to manage the hitherto uncrowded airspace directly above our heads.\nIn the US, the FAA has slowly started to relax its rules, and as CES opened it gave permission to two firms keen to use the unpiloted craft to help their business.\nIt's a small step, as the FAA said it had received more than 200 other requests to use drones commercially.\nIt's a fair bet that many more firms have not requested permission and are flouting the rules.\nThere's no doubt that the buzz around drones is threatening to leave the regulators far behind.\nClick here for more coverage from the BBC at CES 2015", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Nash, their first child, was born in Johannesburg in 1974.\nBut not keen on their family growing up under apartheid, the Nash's made their next move. This time to Canada.\nThe family relocated to Regina, Saskatchewan, and finally Vancouver Island, welcoming two other children along the way.\nFrom a young age Nash, who now has the likes of Red Hot Chilli Peppers star Flea on speed dial, had dreamed of sporting greatness. But it had nothing to do with basketball.\n\"I may have grown up on the west coast of Canada but in a British household and my dad was an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan just like his dad,\" Steve recalls.\n\"Spurs are a way of life for me. Football was my first love but I was better at basketball.\n\"I reckon my love of playing football and that competitive spirit definitely helped my basketball career.\"\nAnd how? He smashed records with university team Santa Clara, starting as he meant to go on.\nBut there's more to Steve Nash than being the National Basketball Association's two-time most valuable player.\nAs mentioned earlier, he has many strings to his bow - the Steve Nash foundation raises millions of dollars for disadvantaged children worldwide, closer to home he has set up a junior basketball league, then there's his media production company, his chain of gyms and the two football clubs he part owns.\nUndeniably the humanitarian focus of his work helped earn him a place alongside The Pope, Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates in Time Magazine's Most Influential People in the World list in 2006.\n'So what is the driving force behind Wales' un-sung son?' I wondered. It was a question I put to him during our chat during his most recent pilgrimage to Tottenham Hotspur's training ground.\n\"My parents taught me about inequality,\" he says.\n\"I was lucky to grow up where and how I did, there is always people less fortunate than you and it is up to us to share in the responsibility to help others.\"\nHis late grandfather Les Hall staked a genetic claim to Nash's humanitarian leanings. After leaving the police, Mr Hall was a social worker and probation officer and, half joking, told me: \"Stevie must have got the caring side from me.\"\n\"I love going to see Steve,\" he went on to say. \"I'm treated like royalty.\"\nAnd Nash said he had enjoyed \"rolling out the red carpet\" for his \"lovely granddad'.\n\"Our elders allow us to succeed and be the people we are fortunate to become,\" he adds.\nFamily means everything according to Nash, who is up early every morning with his three children from his first marriage, to get them ready for school.\nHe has spoken about the \"really great home and family\" he has built with Lilla Frederick, the former US junior volleyball player who he married in September.\nkeeping it in the family extends to his business dealings as his parents help run his foundation.\n\"He wants to make a difference in everything he does,\" Mrs Nash told me of her son.\n\"He's a really great guy and cares about everybody, whether that is his team-mates or children he has never met.\n\"Above all, that is what makes us, as his parents, so proud.\"\nNash occasionally visits London, naturally squeezing in a Spurs game, so knows all about where his father grew up. He is now keen to explore more of his mother's home.\n\"I would definitely love to take the kids to Wales to see where their nanny and great grandparents lived,\" said Nash, referring to twin 12-year-old daughters, Lola and Bella, and five-year-old son Matteo.\nIndeed his Welsh heritage came to the forefront this summer as he watched the Welsh football team reach the European Championships semi-final.\n\"Wales were so exciting to watch with terrific performances but what I loved was their togetherness and fighting spirit,\" he says.\n\"I'm sure everyone back in Wales was immensely proud and drawn to them as a group.\n\"I watched every game from home in southern California, Wales were so charismatic. They had the country on fire for a couple of weeks.\n\"What got me was that belief and unwillingness to look across the line and see a team that most people would have picked ahead of them.\n\"Getting to the semi-final proved they are in with a shout against anyone in the world now.\n\"And being a Spurs fan, I love Gareth Bale. He is a truly world class player. He was fantastic for us when he hit his stride and I think he has been fantastic for Real Madrid, under a lot of pressure. He always rises to occasion in the big matches.\n\"And as a fan of football I'm glad to see Swansea in the Premier League.

If any Catholic wanted to ignore it they would need \"very good reasons - based not on personal or political opinion, but on science\".\nFor some Catholics, this may prove an unwelcome Papal intervention into a highly politicised subject.\nBut the aid agency Cafod said its poll with YouGov showed the vast majority (70%) of Catholics say their community will heed the message of the Pope on climate change.\nWhether it will prove persuasive for American Republican lawmakers - around a third of whom are Catholic - is yet to be seen.\nFollow Roger on Twitter.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

But it normally degrades very quickly.\nNot for the duck-billed bottom feeders though. Or for echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters - another iconic Australian species found to carry the unusual hormone.\nBoth produce a long-lasting form of it, offering the tantalising prospect of creating something similar for human diabetes sufferers.\nLead researcher Prof Frank Grutzer told the BBC's Greg Dunlop why the researchers had decided to look at the platypus and its insulin mechanisms: \"We knew from genome analysis that there was something weird about the platypus's metabolic control system because they basically lack a functional stomach.\"\nThey are not the only animals to use insulin against enemies. The gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the US and Mexico, and the geographer cone, a dangerous sea snail which can kill entire schools of fish by releasing insulin into the sea, both also weaponise the chemical.\n\"That's obviously something that can be powerful in venom,\" Prof Grutzer said, though he stressed it was not what had led them to the discovery. \"It was really coincidental,\" he said.\nHe emphasised that much more research was needed before the discovery could, if ever, lead to a human treatment: \"An important experiment is going to be putting this it into mice and see how it affects blood glucose levels. That's certainly very high on our priority list.\n\"But to get to a drug is a very long journey.

Then, with time running out, Novakovic struck.\nIt was a wonderful finish from the 37-year-old as he brushed off the challenge of Ash Taylor before arrowing a shot beyond the despairing dive of Lewis.\nBut Taylor redeemed himself with a determined contribution to set up Hayes' sidefoot finish minutes later.\nThat gives Aberdeen greater hope of reaching the play-off round, but Maribor know they will progress if they avoid losing a goal next week.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

His task: to keep his emotions under control and focus on the job of firing nine-time winners Madrid into the Champions League quarter finals.\nIt was all about concentration. Ronaldo never once looked up at the vast Sir Alex Ferguson stand over his left shoulder as he practised shooting from 20 yards just to the left of centre - and finding the net every time.\nWarm-ups done and it was time for team embraces. High-fives all round. Madrid's players were as one and after a few stretching routines to finish, it was time to head back for the Special One's final instructions - the final team talk from Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho.\nRonaldo emerged again at 19:41 GMT. This time the atmosphere was hot, red hot.  And at 19:44 there was a special moment as the PA announcer ran through the team line-ups. \"And it's a special welcome back to number seven Cristiano Ronaldo,\" he boomed.\nRonaldo waved, thumped his chest, waved again. His head bowed for a respectful moment before putting his hand back on to his chest. Just for a moment, those emotions must have threatened to run away from him.\nAnd the Manchester United support welcomed him back with a standing ovation which lasted until after referee Cuneyt Cakir started the match.\nUnited had the better of the first half and largely managed to shackle Ronaldo.\nWhen Sergio Ramos steered the ball into his own net to give the home side a 1-0 lead on the night, Old Trafford erupted and Ronaldo's head went down. He looked momentarily forlorn.\nAnd then the match changed irreversibly. Nani was shown a contentious red card for a high challenge on Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa.\nFurious United manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned cheerleader from the touchline while Ronaldo - knowing the Red Devils were vulnerable - immediately switched to a more central role.\nIt was emotional, it was unbelievable. I don't have words to explain what I feel\nWith attack-minded midfielder Luka Modric on for right-back Arbeloa, there was much more room for Ronaldo and Real Madrid set about exposing the 10 men of United.\nWhen Modric struck with a dipping, 25-yard equaliser, Ronaldo did not celebrate. He was far away to the left and not involved in the move. Three minutes later, he would be.\nAlmost inevitably, it was Ronaldo who secured Madrid's victory when he squeezed Gonzalo Higuain's cross in at the far post to silence the United fans. He held his arms half up above his head, knowing he had just broken 70,000 hearts.\nRonaldo could have added to his two goals in the two legs, but David de Gea twice denied him a fairytale hat-trick on the night.\nThe final whistle brought agony for United and mixed emotions for Ronaldo, who hugged Nemanja Vidic and Wayne Rooney before receiving another rapturous ovation from the United supporters near the players' tunnel.\nThis was Ronaldo's 18th Champions League match at Old Trafford. He has only been on the losing side once, but this victorious return ended with mixed emotions.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.\nYes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.\nBefore the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.\nFor the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.\nAnd because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.\nNot easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.\nThere is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.\nAlso, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.\nBecause security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.\nDespite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.\nRight now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.\nIn one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "In the 2006 movie Superman Returns the young super hero plunges to Earth from planet Krypton, landing in the wide, undulating plains of Smallville, Kansas.\nHis spacecraft pierces the region's rich black soils and - so the story goes - Superman is raised on this sweeping farmland where he learns to run and jump and fly.\nA decade on from the filming of the Hollywood blockbuster, the real life  location - Breeza on the Liverpool Plains of rural New South Wales - is bracing itself not against kryptonite but against coal.\nEarlier this month, Chinese company Shenhua received Australian government approval for a massive open-cut coal mine three kilometres from tiny Breeza.\nThe approval was one of the last hurdles in the company's mission to dig up 10 million tonnes of black coal a year to ship from Newcastle 282km (170 miles) to the east.\nThe project has been almost eight years in the making but it is only now that a very public fight has broken out between the region's competing stakeholders.\nWith a physical footprint far larger than the City of Sydney local council area, the Shenhua Watermark mine has been described by local farmers as agricultural genocide.\nIt will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week over its 30-year life span.\nOne such farmer, Fiona Simson, described the Liverpool Plains as an iconic agricultural region because of its outstanding natural resources.\nMs Simson, whose cropping farm is 50km from the proposed mine, is a former president of the NSW Farmers Association.\n\"We must and will keep fighting,\" she told the BBC. \"This project is not in the national interest.\"\nThe Liverpool Plains is often referred to as NSW's food bowl and is counted among the best agricultural land in Australia because of its fertile black soils, temperate climate, good rainfall, and rich surface and underground water resources.\nThe Association says fighting the A$1.2bn ($887m, √Ç¬£570m) mine is the most important challenge facing NSW farmers.\nShenhua says the mine will not damage the region's groundwater supplies and promises to look after vulnerable ecological communities.\nAnd Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt says the mine is subject to some of \"the strictest conditions in Australian history\".\nBut the approval has deepened a rift between Australia's governing Liberal party and its coalition partner, The Nationals - which has traditionally represented farmers - in a relationship already strained by the expansion of coal seam gas (CSG) mining over farming land.\nEarlier this month, about 120 people protested against CSG exploration in Gloucester, about 260km north of Sydney.\nIt was the 14th protest in that area, and one of hundreds of similar protests by farmers, Indigenous Australian land owners, conservationists and urban residents against the encroachment of coal and gas extraction onto rural, and in a few cases, urban land.\nAgriculture Minister and Nationals member Barnaby Joyce, whose electorate of New England takes in the proposed Shenhua mine, has publicly condemned Mr Hunt's decision to approve it.\n\"I think it is ridiculous that you would have a major mine in the midst of Australia's best agricultural land,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and leader of The Nationals, Warren Truss, seems to agree.\n\"The Nationals recognise the vital role that the coal mining industry plays in our national economy, but we believe that prime agricultural land should be preserved for its vital role in producing food for future generations,\" his spokesman told the BBC.\nThe Nationals' inability to hold back the tide of black coal has left many farmers frustrated, forcing them into unnatural alliances with environmentalists and the Greens party and leading to the formation of groups like Lock the Gate.\n\"We should not put our food bowl in jeopardy for the short-term benefit of a coal mine,\" says NSW Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham.\n\"Our capacity to feed ourselves is obviously fundamental to the national interest,\" he says.\nThe Nationals have already felt the pinch of rural dissatisfaction at the ballot box.  At the NSW election in March, the party lost the northern seat of Ballina to the Greens and nearby Lismore nearly went the same way.\nThere are 110 black coal mines across Australia. Another 91 new mines or expansions of existing mines are awaiting approval, according to Greenpeace.\nIn many cases, farmers who have worked the same land for generations are finding themselves forced off that land, says Greenpeace campaigner Dr Nikola Casule.\n\"These sorts of alliances [between farmers and environmentalists] are becoming more and more common,\" he says.\nBut Ms Simson says the issue should not be about politics.\n\"All sides of politics have had a hand in this,\" she says of the Shenhua mine.\n\"The people in the region feel let down by not just the Nationals.\n\"If [the Labor Party] had still been in power, we'd potentially still be in the same situation now.\"\nSaffron Howden is a Sydney-based writer.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
