{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Later chronicles of Genghis Khan's death implicate a princess from what empire in his death? Context: In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of present-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia and Korea. It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.

If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well.

Context: As of April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7% of the entire student population. Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can't charge tuition fees (they can charge \"attendance dues\" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation's then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is the only divisor besides 1 that a prime number can have? Context: A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 ¬∑ 3, 1 ¬∑ 1 ¬∑ 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually. Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased.

They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people.

While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What does ATP mean? Context: Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: The lithosphere moves over which mantle n the theory of plate tectonics? Context: The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries. Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, were explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart. Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology.

Context: The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.

Context: It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What articles state that unless conferred, powers remain with member states? Context: To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What does the current high level of population have a large impact on? Context: The smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation. This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What type of issues are members typically allowed to vote as they please? Context: The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare.

Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What happens when bathocyroe and ocyropsis clap their lobes together? Context: Lobates have eight comb-rows, originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids.

The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x).

However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states.

After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling‚Äîsignals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What did Philip I wish to do around 1539? Context: From December 1539, Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who wanted to marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting. Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\".

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What did the Court of Justice reason were controlled in all member states in Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht? Context: The \"freedom to provide services\" under TFEU article 56 applies to people who give services \"for remuneration\", especially commercial or professional activity. For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi√´n a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.

In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Why do the island archipelagos comprise a smaller number of electors? Context: Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as \"Constituency MSPs\". Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a Khitan prince, Chu'Tsai, who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: In what century was quantum mechanics made?  Context: The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212‚Äì219", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC being completed on February 9; following the sale, Disney renamed its new subsidiary ABC Inc. In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the travails of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: If the apparant force of two fermions is attractive, what is the spin function? Context: However, already in quantum mechanics there is one \"caveat\", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the \"spin\", and there is the Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what? Context: The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists. Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J. A. Hobson (1858‚Äì1940), Joseph Schumpeter (1883‚Äì1950), Thorstein Veblen (1857‚Äì1929), and Norman Angell (1872‚Äì1967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What does the matching helper T cell release when it binds with the MHC:antigen complex of the B cell? Context: A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Some of these are also known as public schools. Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools. The name \"public school\" is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation. According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov? Context: On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal ‚Äì and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Who did the Dutch fight in the Dutch Revolt?

The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the \"Apologie\" of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Rock units become thicker and shorten when placed under this type of compression.  Context: When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What has replaced lower skilled workers in the United States? Context: Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper‚ÄìSamuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is an example of illegal disobedience? Context: Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\" Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.

Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What dynasty shared artistic inspiration with the Yuan? Context: In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Sh≈çs≈çin, in Japan.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What type of vote must the Council pass in order to approve of any changes recommended by Parliament?  Context: To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs mission to \"make the world safe for democracy\" changed all this. They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a \"racket\" by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.

Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What do power station steam turbines use as a cold sink in the absence of CHP? Context: Where CHP is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: If NP is not equal to P, viewed through this lens, what type of problems can also be considered intractable? Context: Problems that can be solved in theory (e.g., given large but finite time), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems. In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the Cobham‚ÄìEdmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 √ó 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Antibody-dependent hypersensitivity belongs to what class of hypersensitivity? Context: Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I ‚Äì IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What happens when starch grains become overly large? Context: Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast. Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis. While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj√≥, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: The unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = ‚àí2, ‚àí4, ..., all zeroes of the Œ∂-function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville? Context: Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, ‚ÄòQuantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States‚Äô. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‚Äòmanifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ‚Äòfundamental pillars of a democratic society‚Äô, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but \"the devil's people\", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a \"scharfe Barmherzigkeit\" (\"sharp mercy\") against the Jews \"to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.\" Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these \"envenomed worms\" would be forced into labour or expelled \"for all time\". In Robert Michael's view, Luther's words \"We are at fault in not slaying them\" amounted to a sanction for murder. \"God's anger with them is so intense,\" Luther concluded, \"that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little.

Context: The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually \"shortening the cutoff\" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (\"kick back\").[citation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries? Context: Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper‚ÄìSamuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What were the years two Regulations that conflicted with an Italian law originate in the Simmenthal SpA case?  Context: Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: At what age did British Gas plc force their workers to retire? Context: First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called \"vertical\" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K√ºc√ºkdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code ¬ß622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K√ºc√ºkdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is needed to pack electrons densely together? Context: It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together.

Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped 120 m (390 ft) and much of the continental margins became exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine.

In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What do young Ctenophores generaly look like? Context: Most species are hermaphrodites‚Äîa single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape.

By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Where have herbivorous fishes been seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton? Context: Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead ends\" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea.

The increased solubility of O\n2 at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of O\n2 in eutrophic water bodies.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is the study of proteins involved in immune response known as? Context: Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: Why is it difficult to resolve disagreements about the changes in the Amazon rainforest? Context: There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What does Kuznets' curve predict about income inequality given time? Context: Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve. Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What issues do member states say the Court of Justice does not have the final say on? Context: Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What were the three parts of Kublai's government? Context: The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: Ê®ûÂØÜÈô¢) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China.

{"text": "[TASK=squad] Question: What is the source of oxygen production through electrocatalytic means? Context: Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O\n2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies.

Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with \"Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity.\" Paul Rose argues that he caused a \"hysterical and demonizing mentality\" about Jews to enter German thought and discourse, a mentality that might otherwise have been absent. Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews: Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany (2012), shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S.

The scenario was designed to illustrate some principles of the weird world of quantum physics. It is an example of quantum superposition, where particles can be in two different states at once. A US-French team created two microwave cavities (the boxes), while the cats were represented by large ensembles of photons. In a twist to the tale, the team showed that the \"cat\" can be in two separate locations at the same time.\nCompact \"gravimeter\": University of Glasgow scientists built a gravimeter - which can make very precise measurements of Earth's gravity - that is both inexpensive and small. The device could be used in mineral exploration, civil engineering and for monitoring volcanoes.\nNearest neighbour: Astronomers discovered evidence for a rocky exoplanet within the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Solar System. The alien world, called Proxima b, is about 1.3 times the size of Earth and could - in theory - sustain liquid water on its surface.\nEntanglement: An international team created and measured a phenomenon called quantum entanglement between two different types of ion - a charged atom or molecule. The discovery could help show the way towards super-fast quantum computers.\nWonder material: Scientists measured a property called negative refraction in the promising material graphene. Negative refraction could be used to create new types of optical devices such as very powerful lenses.\nNuclear clock: German physicists detected an elusive transition in the element thorium-229 which could allow the development of a \"nuclear clock\". Such a clock would be much more stable than the conventional atomic clocks in use today.\nAmazing lens: A team at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland created a new microscope lens, called the Mesolens, that offers the unique combination of a large field of view with high resolution.\nFast computing: Quantum computers could herald a technological revolution, but scientists have to overcome many hurdles before they can produce \"real world\" devices. In 2016, Austrian scientists used a quantum computer to simulate the physics that describes fundamental interactions between sub-atomic particles - a significant development in this field.\nTiny engine: A team at the University of Mainz in Germany created a heat engine based on just one atom.

He also sent a copy to the UAE ambassador in Washington.\nThere has been no reply.\nMr Cassim says he is struggling to find work in the US as a result of being unable to declare a spent conviction for endangering national security in the UAE.

There were around 130 inmates and only three toilets. And none of those toilets flushed.\"\nHe added: \"We gave our souls to that city, and to be treated this way is something that has been incredibly difficult to deal with.\"\nThe impact on the family -  who spent the majority of their lives working in Dubai - has been huge.

He was not advised of the charges against him until five months into his detention.\"\nMr Cassim is now seeking a pardon and restitution.\nLast January, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed acknowledged to the BBC's Jon Sopel, just a few days after Mr Cassim's release, that mistakes had been made in his case.\nDuring the interview, Mr Sopel said: \"The kid said: 'I did nothing wrong, we had no idea of what our crime was, we had no idea how long we'd be in prison for.

They have sharp claws, teeth and strong muscles.\"\nFrom blurry photos of the Beast of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, to reports of a lion on the loose in Essex in 2012, the UK has a long tradition of spotting big cats.\nMost of these claims are dismissed as misidentifications, hoaxes or even hallucinations, but not in this case.\nIn 1903, the unusual cat was donated to the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's records state that it had been shot after attacking and killing two dogs close to Newton Abbot in Devon.\nUnsure of exactly what it was, the exotic beast was stuffed, its skeleton preserved, and then the remains were tucked away in the museum's stores.\nMore than a century later, the cat was unearthed by a scientist who thought the find might be significant.\nAn analysis of the skeleton and mounted skin revealed that the animal was a Canadian lynx, which is about two to three times the size of a domestic cat and is usually found in Canada and the northern states of the US.\nThe researchers found that the animal's teeth were badly decayed.\nDr Barnett said:  \"We think it had probably been in captivity at some point in its life.\n\"It had lost all of its incisors, which would have been a pretty debilitating injury for a wild cat, but not a problem for one in captivity.\n\"It also had massive amounts of plaque on its molars, which are indication of it not having a wild diet - something with lots of wet cat food, essentially ready-processed meat like steaks.\"\nThe researchers believe that the lynx had been in captivity for some time, but they were unable to find any records of the cat's owner.\n\"Was it someone's pet? Was it part of a small menagerie that was travelling through the area? There aren't really any zoos nearby where it could have escaped from,\" Dr Barnett said.\nThe team is also unsure how long the animal had been at large in Devon before it was killed.\nIts decayed teeth would have limited its chances in the wild, but the lynx is an adaptable animal, and may have been able to survive by preying on small mammals.\nWhile many big cat sightings remain unverified, sometimes the rumours do turn out to be true, and the team believes that the Canadian lynx is the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK.\nAnother case relates to a live puma that was captured in Inverness-shire in 1980 and had been living in the wild for a long period of time. It was called Felicity, and placed in a zoo.\nBut Dr Barnett said that these cases were few and far between.\nHe said: \"It's all very good saying you saw a lion in Essex or a tiger in Shropshire, or wherever.

There have been concerns over protectionist measures for local industries and a method of settling trade disputes.\nBut it may boost intra-Africa trade.

For a start, customs officials and getting across borders is notoriously cumbersome in Africa. Also, manufacturing on a local level needs to be boosted.\nThe UN said three years ago that the best way to boost African trade was to concentrate on developing local capacity, rather than just lowering tariffs. That way, Africans would have things to sell to each other at prices that are more competitive than outsiders.\nIf that happens within a new free trade area, that's what would boost intra-African trade. Also there are various disputes between the members of this agreement, from gripes to outright hostility.\nSo, while there's a good deal of political will behind the TFTA, how it works on the ground will be the proof of the pudding.\nAnd that won't be apparent for months or years to come. Pardon my cynicism, but the three blocs involved in this are by no means functioning perfectly.\nWith all the hype surrounding this TFTA, you'd think it was the panacea to all of Africa's economic and trade problems. It's not. But it is a tiny step in the right direction.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Increased government spending will be responsible for one-third of the increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2016-2017, latest government figures show.\nWhat this essentially means is that the government will primarily drive economic growth in the current financial year.\nThis is likely to continue in 2017-2018 as well. The annual budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday seems to suggest as much.\nThe government has allocated 480bn rupees ($7.1bn; √Ç¬£5.6bn) to a scheme which guarantees every rural household 100 days of work each year. This is the highest allocation ever made to the programme.\nThe increased spending on the programme is intended to alleviate the negative impact of the government decision to ban high value notes in rural and semi-rural areas of India. A majority of transactions in these areas happen in cash, which has been in short supply since the rupee ban in November last year.\nThe jobs guarantee programme is also intended to alleviate the impact of the rupee ban on the informal manufacturing sector which operates in cash and tends to employ many semi-skilled and unskilled people who migrate to cities from rural India.\nThe government has also increased the allocation to an affordable housing scheme by more than 50% to 230bn rupees which is also expected to create some employment in rural India.  Close to half of India's population is engaged in agriculture which contributes only around 18% of GDP.\nThe allocation to 29 schemes sponsored by the central government has gone up by 21.6% and the allocation to the infrastructure sector has gone up by 13.5%.\nOver and above this, the government has increased the lending target to a scheme that gives loans at low interest rates to micro-finance institutions and non-banking finance institutions. These in turn lend money to micro and small business entities engaged in manufacturing, trading and services activities.\nRural spending promise in India budget\nIndia admits rupee ban bad for economy\nTo cut a long story short, the Modi government is trying to spend its way out of trouble, but it is not going overboard with it.\nA part of this pump-priming became necessary because of the government's rupee ban self-goal, which is expected to pull down economic growth in 2016-2017.\nThe Economic Survey for 2016-2017 released on Tuesday, projected GDP growth at between 6.5-6.75% in 2016-2017, down from 7.9% in 2015-2016. The question is what economic growth could have been without the rupee ban.\nWhen pushed in to a corner, most governments try to spend their way out of trouble.\nNevertheless, government spending is not always as effective as private spending. In the Indian case, a major reason is massive leakage.  This means that a large portion of government spending does not reach those it is meant for and is instead, siphoned off by the bureaucracy expected to distribute it.\nOne way to tackle this is for the government to concentrate on running a few important schemes on which it can spend the bulk of its money and focus its time and attention on.\nThe Economic Survey points out that \"the Budget for 2016-17 indicates that there are about 950 central sector and centrally sponsored sub-schemes in India\".\nOne negative impact of running so many schemes is that \"in many cases, the poorest districts are the ones grappling with inadequate funds. This is evidence of acute misallocation.\"\nA very important part of economic reform in India would be to bring down the number of these schemes. But that, as they always say, is easier said than done.\nAnd as always, this budget missed out on this opportunity as well.\nVivek Kaul can be reached at vivek.kaul@gmail.com", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'.\nBut one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India.\nAt the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes.\nAnd the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention.\nThe reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent.\nThis week Greenpeace won a small victory.\nOn Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad.\nIn January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India.\nBut the war is far from over.\nThe charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO.\nA secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity.\nIt said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate.\nGreenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy.\nCoal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production.\nIt is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change.\nAnd, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights.\nChina's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions.\nMeanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020.\nAlmost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute.\nThat's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace.\nThe charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas.\nThe NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group.\nCoal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company.\nThe Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister.\nBut the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism.\nIndia likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a \"chilling effect\" on the nation's democracy.\nWhen the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy.\nMr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Now the government and business groups are trying to get workers to take a small step to reclaim their lives by leaving work early one day a month.\nThe scheme, dubbed \"Premium Friday\", suggests companies make staff go home at 15:00 on the last Friday of the month, starting in February.\nIt has been given renewed impetus by the suicide of a woman who was working more than 100 hours overtime a month at Japan's biggest ad agency, Dentsu.\nHer death was ruled to be a case of \"karoshi\" and has led to an investigation, an announcement the firm's chief executive will resign and deep concern in Japan at the country's work culture.\nBut with around 2,000 deaths a year linked to overwork, few believe the voluntary scheme represents anything more than a small step towards changing attitudes and it is unclear how many companies will take it up.\nIt is not the first time overwork has been seen as a problem nor the first time anyone has tried to do something about it.\nAmong other initiatives, the government has in the past tried to make employees take more of the leave they are entitled to - Japan's labour ministry says they only take about half - without much success.\nThe number of public holidays in Japan this year increased to 16 in part aimed at forcing people to take breaks.\nThe government has also tried to encourage more flexible hours, allowing government workers to start and leave work early in the summer and even switching off the lights in some offices late in the evening, something Dentsu is also now trying.\nWorkers are increasingly taking the initiative to go home on time some days too, even announcing it on social media to encourage others to do the same.\nBut while this has helped change the idea that working excessive overtime is necessarily a good thing, none has had a made much of a dent in the hours themselves.\nAround 22% of the population work more than 49 hours a week according to 2014 figures from the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training, behind South Korea at 35% but ahead of the US, where 16% of workers put in those kind of hours.\nFor the government and business groups, there is an element of self-interest too.\nJapan's economy has stagnated for more than two decades. The situation has been made worse by low consumption spending and a very low birth rate, both of which are aggravated by workers spending most of their waking hours at a desk.\nProductivity and efficiency also suffer from firms having staff perpetually on hand, as companies don't invest in labour-saving technologies.\nToshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, told the BBC that private consumption could rise by as much as 124 billion yen ($1bn; ¬£860m) every Premium Friday if \"100%\" of those eligible headed home at 3pm on those days.\nBut he stresses no one knows how many people will take up the idea and that total participation is unlikely, which could mean a much smaller boost to the economy.\nWhy would companies and workers not take part? Well, being first to make such a change could be painful.\nCompanies face higher costs and Japanese workers often feel guilty at leaving their colleagues behind.\n\"Japanese workers worry about letting down their colleagues\" says Mr Nagahama. \"They have a strong sense of working as a team.\"\nHaving employees work less is especially difficult for Japan's many small businesses, which are battling to keep costs down. The fact that many of them are family-run makes an early walk-out even trickier.\nEven with Premium Friday, Mr Nagahama points out some employees may make up the time on other days or even do other jobs in their newly-gained leisure time, which would nullify the point of the scheme.\nIt is not even clear if the government ministry behind the idea will be participating, though Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko has reportedly promised that he will not have appointments after 15:00 on those Fridays.\nDespite doubts about the scheme, supporters hope the modest goal of an early finish once a month combined with the backing of government and industry will encourage uptake, and eventually more fundamental change in workplace culture.\nThe campaign is also promoting commercial opportunities for restaurants, shops, travel companies and other businesses who could benefit, in the hope that firms will see the benefit of increased leisure time for employees.\nOf course, changing deeply-rooted attitudes to work will be difficult. Many previous attempts have failed. But ironically the effort might be helped by Japanese workers' declining corporate loyalty.\nCut adrift by years of restructuring from the lifetime employment bargain that bound their fathers to a single firm, younger Japanese people may find that the chance to head to the izakaya (pub) a bit earlier some Fridays is just the nudge they need to adopt a better work-life balance.\nReporting by Simeon Paterson.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

By 2009-2010, the continent welcomed around 37,000 visitors.\nBut nobody lives there permanently!\nIn the winter, the sea around Antarctica freezes over creating what is called sea ice. This makes the continent almost twice as big in winter.\nThe end of the summer in Antarctica is in March and the end of the winter is in September - opposite to in the UK!\nThis is because Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere, which faces the Sun during our winter time.\nIn 1959, several countries signed an agreement called the Antarctic Treaty, saying that Antarctica would be a peaceful place that they would work together to look after.\nWithout an international agreement like this, people would be free to do what they wanted there.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Online security specialists Cloudflare said it recorded the \"biggest\" attack of its kind on Monday.\nHackers used weaknesses in the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a system used to synchronise computer clocks, to flood servers with huge amounts of data.\nThe technique could potentially be used to force popular services offline.\nSeveral experts had predicted that the NTP would be used for malicious purposes.\nThe target of this latest onslaught is unknown, but it was directed at servers in Europe, Cloudflare said.\nAttackers used a well-known method to bring down a system known as Denial of Service (DoS) - in which huge amounts of data are forced on a target, causing it to fall over.\nCloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince said his firm had measured the \"very big\" attack at about 400 gigabits per second (Gbps), 100Gbps larger than an attack on anti-spam service Spamhaus last year.\nIn a report published three months ago, Cloudflare warned that attacks on the NTP were on the horizon and gave details of how web hosts could best try to protect their customers.\nNTP servers, of which there are thousands around the world, are designed to keep computers synchronised to the same time.\nThe fundamentals of the NTP began operating in 1985. While there have been changes to the system since then, it still operates in much the same way.\nA computer needing to synchronise time with the NTP will send a small amount of data to make the request. The NTP will then reply by sending data back.\nThe vulnerability lies with two weaknesses. Firstly, the amount of data the NTP sends back is bigger than the amount it receives, meaning an attack is instantly amplified.\nSecondly, the original computer's location can be \"spoofed\", tricking the NTP into sending the information back to somewhere else.\nIn this attack, it is likely that many machines were used to make requests to the NTP. Hackers spoofed their location so that the massive amounts of data from the NTP were diverted to a single target.\n\"Amplification attacks like that result in an attacker turning a small amount of bandwidth coming from a small number of machines into a massive traffic load hitting a victim from around the internet,\" Cloudflare explained in a blog outlining the vulnerability, posted last month.\nThe NTP is one of several protocols used within the infrastructure of the internet to keep things running smoothly.\nUnfortunately, despite being vital components, most of these protocols were designed and implemented at a time when the prospect of malicious activity was not considered.\n\"A lot of these protocols are essential, but they're not secure,\" explained Prof Alan Woodward, an independent cyber-security consultant, who had also raised concerns over NTP last year.\n\"All you can really do is try and mitigate the denial of service attacks. There are technologies around to do it.\"\nMost effective, Prof Woodward suggested, was technology that was able to spot when a large amount of data was heading for one destination - and shutting off the connection.\nCloudflare's Mr Prince said that while his firm had been able to mitigate the attack, it was a worrying sign for the future.\n\"Someone's got a big, new cannon,\" he tweeted. \"Start of ugly things to come.\"\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "[TASK=xsum] The White House has been quick to note that this is a \"working\" vacation. The president won't be leaving the duties of office totally behind.\nIt's fair to say, however, that Mr Trump will spend more than a little bit of time on the fairways. The White House is coy about how much the president has played golf so far during his time in office, but given that he's visited his golf properties at least 43 times so far, he almost certainly has teed up more at this point in his administration than any past president.\nSo while he's lining up his shots over the next two weeks, will memories of his past six months in office break his concentration? Will an ill-timed twinge of concern turn what would have been a solid drive into a wayward slice or cause a sure-thing birdie putt to lip out of the hole?\nHow many of his apparently unlimited supply of mulligans will he have to use to soothe a troubled mind?\nThe president may comfort himself with thoughts of low unemployment or a booming stock market. He may smile when he recalls the cheering crowds at recent campaign-style rallies or the unexpected coup of the Democratic West Virginia governor joining the Republican Party.\nBut as any vacationing piker knows, when a holiday ends there's twice as much work and a load of problems that have piled up in the meantime. Even if the president sails through his vacation without a care, there are plenty of troubles brewing back in Washington. Here's a look at some of them.\nPerhaps the single biggest legislative accomplishment of the Trump presidency so far is the law imposing new sanctions on Iran and North Korea and strengthening existing ones on Russia. Given that the president signed the measure with extreme reservations, it's safe to say things aren't going according to plan.\nEfforts to repeal and replace Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms were dramatically dynamited by a handful of Republicans and a united Democratic Party in the Senate. An overhaul of the tax law is currently barely a glimmer in legislators' eyes. The proposed modifications to the legal immigration system recently unveiled at the White House have been deemed dead on arrival in Congress, while any kind of infrastructure spending package is going nowhere fast.\nWhen the politicians return to Congress in September they will have their hands full with more pressing matters. Hardliners may attempt to prevent the treasury from issuing new government debt - raising the \"debt ceiling\" - without extracting spending cuts. New appropriations bills must be passed to avoid a government shutdown.\nAll this leaves little time for big new legislative efforts to reach fruition before the calendar flips to 2018 and legislators start thinking about their re-election campaigns.\nView from the tee: The president faces a treacherous par four, with water on both sides and sand around the green.\nIf Mr Trump's domestic agenda creates headaches, the international outlook has the makings of a splitting migraine.\nNorth Korea continues to press ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, despite harsh presidential tweets and steely gazes from the vice-president. The administration has warned of grave consequences, but what's his next step?\nMr Trump has called on China to do more - while at the same time threatening to take punitive trade measures against that nation for intellectual property theft. While Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a cordial summit in Mar-a-Lago in April, Sino-American relations could be heading toward treacherous ground.\nThe president also has some hard choices to make when it comes to Afghanistan, where his generals are calling for an increase in troop numbers to break a strategic stalemate with Taliban insurgents. While Mr Trump often has said he will defer to the Pentagon on military matters, some of his civilian advisers view an increased commitment as counter to candidate Trump's America-first foreign policy promises.\nAs if that weren't enough, Iran could also become a political flashpoint if the president follows through with his reported desire not to certify that the nation is complying with the multi-party nuclear agreement when it next comes up for review in October. It's another area where various presidential aides are giving diametrically opposed advice - and the president will have to be the decider.\nView from the tee: A high-risk, high-reward scenario where almost everyone will be relieved if the president decides to play it safe.\nAt a Thursday evening rally in West Virginia, Mr Trump attempted to paint the ongoing investigation into possible links between his campaign and Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election as an us-against-them situation.\n\"They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story,\" he said.\nThe president's speech came on the heels of news that special counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury to assist in his investigation - giving him new powers to subpoena documents, solicit sworn testimony and, with sufficient evidence, bring criminal indictments.\nOver the past weeks reports have circulated that Mr Mueller is casting a wide net in his probe, looking at the controversial June 2016 meeting between senior members of the Trump campaign and Russian advocates, as well as the business dealings of Mr Trump and those close to him.\nThen there are the ongoing congressional committee investigations. Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort have already spoken with investigators behind closed doors. They - or Donald Trump Jr - could be called for public testimony at some point in the months ahead, which would make for a national political spectacle.\nThe concurrent investigations could all end up duds - or set off explosions that shake the very foundations of the Trump presidency. The answer lies somewhere on the other side of August.\nView from the tee: In the words of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler in Caddyshack, 'The heavy stuff isn't going to come down for quite a while'.\nJust over two weeks ago Mr Trump had a chief of staff, a press secretary and no communications director. As he heads to New Jersey he has a new chief of staff, a new press secretary and a recently fired communications director.\nHe has an attorney general who says the president's swipes at him over the past few weeks were \"kind of hurtful\" and who just held a press event that seemed primarily designed to convince Mr Trump that, yes, he's trying really hard to fight leaks, just like he asked.\nHis national security adviser, HR McMaster, is systematically removing aides brought in before he took over from Michael Flynn - individuals who were more in step with White House adviser Steve Bannon's fiercely nationalistic worldview.\nAs a result Mr McMaster himself has become the target of a concerted attempt by some on the right to force him from his job. A website called McMasterLeaks featured a cartoon of the retired general as a puppet being controlled by liberal billionaire (and conservative bogeyman) George Soros, who himself was puppeteered by \"the Rothschilds\". (The website has since changed \"Rothschilds\" to \"Saudis\" after accusations of anti-Semitism.)\nThe long knives have come out over the past two weeks, forcing Republican establishment figures like Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer from their senior White House jobs.\nMr Kelly, another former general, is supposed to be bringing new discipline to the West Wing, but the verdict on his efforts won't come until long after Mr Trump has returned to the Oval Office.\nView from the tee: A golf course can't operate when the caddies are at war with each other.\nThe president has a lot to worry about as he rides around the links in his golf cart, but the real moment of reckoning may not come until he's back in the clubhouse, freshening up after his round.\nAs he checks his hair in the bathroom mirror, he may come face to face with the biggest aid - or obstacle - to his long-term presidential success. Himself.\nTime and time again over the past six-plus months Mr Trump has undermined his agenda with ill-timed tweets or off-message comments, needlessly complicating what is already the hardest job in the nation.\nHe managed to alienate several Republican senators - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona - who were instrumental in sinking his healthcare reform legislation.\nJust last week he took multiple swipes at Congress, including the leadership of his own party, saying they \"look like fools\" for not doing away with the legislative filibuster and laying the current poor state of US-Russia relations at their feet.\nGiven that the president needs Congress's help in the days ahead, such antics seem of questionable wisdom.\nAlready one Republican Senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has made a very visible break with the president. The media are buzzing with reports that others may be plotting to go their own way.\nCongress has tied the president's hands on Russian sanctions. Legislation is being drafted that would limit his ability to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller. The Senate is staying in session just to keep the president from using a procedural trick to replace Mr Sessions without their consent. Despite the president's urging, there are now bipartisan efforts to come up with ways to modify Obamacare and not repeal it.\nView from the tee: Golfing legend Ben Hogan once said \"the most important shot in golf is the next one\".

It's where people learn about new products coming to market.\"\nAnd plenty of studios have capitalised on the excitement around E3 to tease their new releases, many squeezing out announcements before doors open on 14 June.\nOf course, if previous years are anything to go by, there are likely to be a few surprises during the week.\nHarvey Smith has worked on critically acclaimed games including cyberpunk role-playing adventure Deus Ex, and stealth-action thriller Dishonored, which won the Bafta award for best game in 2013.\nThe BBC asked him to share the games he's most looking forward to at E3.\nOverland\nI'm a big fan of Adam Saltsman. His game Capsule - an incredibly tense and claustrophobic space travel game - is sublime. Overland is a thoughtful, soulful, post-apocalyptic road trip game with a beautifully laconic art style. Every year, there's an indie game or two that just feels like it was made for me. This year, it might be Overland.\nLuna\nI really like Robin Hunicke's work and the art style is super cute - but it goes beyond that. I love that you're not really sure what kind of game it will be. It's the combination of looking sweet and naive on the surface, but somehow hinting at something more complex and sophisticated. I suspect it's a bit of a Trojan horse in that respect.\nNo Man's Sky\nWe play games for a variety of reasons. Some people play games to demonstrate mastery over systems; some play to marvel at a reality beyond ours; some play to feel a sense of wonder at the ecological grandeur of the world. No Man's Sky promises all of that, seducing us with unknown possibilities.\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\nAs one of the people to have participated in the genesis of the Deus Ex brand of dystopia, I am full of hope for the new Deus Ex game. If it's all I want it to be, it will present players with a gritty world gone wrong, challenging moral terrain, and flexible game systems that lead to improvisational \"play\" in the true sense of the word.\nState of Decay 2 (Rumoured)\nAs a fan of often nihilistic zombie fiction, I was really drawn to State of Decay. The original was a gem in the rough. The best thing about the game was the way it kept enabling player-driven stories. So many times, I got into a tight spot of my own making, then managed to get out of it through creative play. Some moments left me sweating and yelling when I got back to home base, and those moments were generally unscripted. If the new game is more polished, this could be really strong.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Rumoured)\nI grew up watching spaghetti westerns. They're problematic, but they occupy a mythic place in my soul. I loved Red Dead Redemption for its pacing and exploration value - watching a good western is cool, but inhabiting one is another thing entirely. I still miss my beautiful horse, killed by a pair of mountain lions, both of which I shot dead and skinned. I hope the developers took note of the stories players told after engaging with the game.\nThree short years have passed since the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One went on sale, but there is an expectation that both consoles will soon be refreshed.\nIn the past, Microsoft and Sony refined their consoles during their lifecycles with cosmetic changes and occasionally some useful upgrades such as a larger hard drive.\nBut this time round more significant changes are planned.\nSony revealed to the Financial Times on Friday that it is working on an upgraded PS4 codenamed Neo. It said it would be able to handle 4K output - four times the detail of 1080p high definition - but would not be ready to unveil at E3.\nSony added it would be more expensive than the basic version, which will continue to be made, but did not say by how much.\n\"I do not believe the new PS4 will be possible of native 4K gaming,\" commented Mr Harding-Rolls.\n\"The cost implications on both the device and content creation make this unfeasible.\n\"It is likely to support 4K video - as this is where the majority of 4K content is emerging - and will probably upscale PS4 games to 4K output.\n\"Whether this upscaling significantly improves the visuals probably depends on the game, the size of the 4K TV it is shown on and the quality of upscaling.\"\nGaming blogs have also suggested that a smaller Xbox One could be unveiled at E3.\nThe console has been criticised for being bulkier than its predecessor, although Microsoft designer Carl Ledbetter has explained the size helps keep the machine cool and allows it to run quietly.\nNintendo has already confirmed it is working on a new console - codenamed NX - but has said it will not be showing  the device at E3.\nVirtual reality was expected to steal the show at last year's E3, but despite high-profile backing from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, gamers with VR headsets are still few and far between.\nHeadsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally making their way onto gamers' faces, so 2016 could be the year that blockbuster titles that attract the masses are announced.\nSony's PlayStation VR is due out in October - perhaps perfectly timed for the highly anticipated space exploration game No Man's Sky to be revealed as a launch title.\nCreator Sean Murray has said it would be a \"perfect fit\" for VR, and it has been tested in Oculus - but he has yet to reveal more.\nMicrosoft currently has no VR hardware of its own, instead focusing on its Hololens augmented reality helmet, which superimposes graphics over real-world views.\nBut the Xbox controller already works with the Oculus Rift headset, and there is speculation that Microsoft will announce a tie-up with the Oculus platform.\n\"Microsoft has been looking at an open approach to VR, inviting manufacturers to use its Windows platform to build their businesses on,\" said Mr Harding-Rolls.\n\"I think it would be a stretch to go from those ideas, to announcing an exclusive agreement to bring a particular VR headset manufacturer to Xbox One.\n\"But it has to put forward strategies to convince Xbox 360 users who haven't converted yet to upgrade.\"\nThe PS4 has pulled ahead of Xbox One in the console race, so gamers will be watching Microsoft closely for exclusives. Gaming blogs have suggested two series featuring the undead will be revived.\n\"We're expecting Dead Rising 4, and State of Decay 2 - both have performed well on the Xbox platform before,\" said Tom Phillips, deputy news editor at Eurogamer.\nSome of last year's biggest announcements - such as first-person shooter Gears of War 4, and role-playing game Scalebound - have yet to be released.\nSony too has yet to deliver on some of its previous announcements, such as The Last Guardian, a fantasy-adventure about a boy who befriends a cat-bird hybrid creature. It was first announced at E3 in 2009.\n\"The Last Guardian has achieved an almost mythical quality by this point,\" said Mr Phillips.\n\"It's finally coming out this year, so hopefully it's the last time we'll see it trailed at E3. But it does feel like when these big games do come out, they are generally well received, as with Uncharted.\n\"This year, I think we'll see Sony hand over the stage to some of the games it has tie-ins with, such as Call of Duty.\"\nThe military-inspired shooter began as a Windows game in 2003, but now offers some add-on content to PlayStation gamers first.\nIt's shaping up to be a relatively quiet E3 for Nintendo, but it is likely to attract attention with its much-delayed Legend of Zelda game, with a new quest for the young sword-wielding hero Link.\nIt is one of the bestselling series of all time, but the latest instalment has been repeatedly delayed. First announced in 2014, is now tipped to be a launch title for the NX console, and could end up being the last big home-grown game Nintendo releases for the Wii U.\nNot everything promised at E3 is successfully delivered.\nUbisoft was criticised after its 2012 demo of Watch Dogs featured superior graphics to those that appeared in the released console games.

It's not just about us knowing best, it's about having other hospitals and doctors saying we want to treat [Charlie] and we think it's the best thing to do.\"\nMs Yates said they were not criticising Great Ormond Street Hospital as \"they do great things\".\nShe said she hoped the judge would take into account new evidence as when the decision was made previously, Charlie's chance was rated at being close to 0% but now this has increased to 10%.\nCharlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome.\nIt is a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage because he is unable to get energy to his organs.\nDoctors have said he now cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow and has irreversible brain damage. His lungs are only able to keep going because of the treatment he is receiving.\nThey have argued he should be allowed to die with dignity.\nBut his parents and supporters have been fighting for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US.\nThe treatment is not a cure - there isn't one - but it has been suggested it could reduce the effects of the disease.\nAlthough doctors in the US have since said the benefits they have seen have not been in cases as advanced as Charlie's.\nUS President Donald Trump and the Vatican have supported the parents' campaign for Charlie to be treated abroad, but a leading expert has described interventions from high-profile figures as \"unhelpful\".\nProf Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said in an open letter that Charlie's situation was \"heartbreaking\" for his parents, but added that even well-meaning interventions from outsiders could be unhelpful.\nMr Gard said: \"If we won the court case and we got to America, and then within the first week of treatment he started suffering and he was in pain, we would let him go.\n\"This isn't about us.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Taking comfort from the fact that, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the UK leads the world for care of people in the final weeks of their life is perhaps a more appropriate reaction.\nThe UK topped the table when the EIU last carried out this exercise in 2010. But the number of countries included has been doubled to 80 in this latest survey, commissioned by the Lien Foundation of Singapore. So for the UK to again lead the pack, including all other wealthy nations, is significant.\nIn essence, the UK scores so highly for the care of patients nearing the end of their life because the NHS is such a well-integrated service.  Health professionals, ranging from hospital doctors to GPs and community nurses, generally work together effectively to ensure patients receive the end of life care they might expect.  This includes pain management through palliative care.  This is not the case in many international healthcare systems.\nThe report praises the UK for having a comprehensive strategy with the NHS working alongside the hospice movement and charities such as Marie Curie and Macmillan. Ensuring that people get to live out their final days in a place of their choice is an area where there has been progress in recent years.\nIts interesting that both the report authors and other experts in the field have gone out of their way to stress there is still plenty of scope to do better.  The Health Ombudsman in England recently highlighted cases where people were badly let down and experienced death without dignity.  Future demand, the report says, is likely to be higher as people live longer and the burden of cancer, dementia and diabetes increases.\nWhile noting the report's findings are \"very encouraging\", the Health Minister Ben Gummer said the Government was determined to go even further to ensure patients and families were involved in decisions about care.\nThe crossbench peer Baroness Finlay has introduced a Palliative Care Bill which will be debated in Parliament this month. The aim she says is to guarantee all patients equal access to services around the clock and regardless of geography.  But she acknowledges that, helped by each of the UK's health administrations having a strategy, there has been improvement.\n\"We are vastly better than we were  - patients are rating good services very highly though the problem is gaps in provision at ground level,\" she says.\nThe hospice movement, she told the Today programme is \"setting a gold standard and leading the world\".\nIts important to give praise where praise is due. In this sensitive area, its easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better.  So to score more highly than Australia and New Zealand, as well as Germany, France and the US is highly commendable.  Richer nations inevitably lead the pack with the Philippines, Bangladesh and Iraq propping up the table.  Affordability of care, with a taxpayer funded health service, is predictably a lot more bearable for British patients than in other economies.\nThe NHS, the hospices and a range of dedicated professionals should be given a pat on the back.  Specialist training and expertise is highlighted by the report, along with successful national policies. We can be reassured that the quality of death in the UK is as high as we might feel it ought to be in a civilised society.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Government finances are forecast to be ¬£122bn worse off than in the spring.\nAmong the chancellor's announcements were:\nMr Hammond said the government would prioritise \"additional high-value investment\" on infrastructure, which would be funded by additional borrowing.\nHe paid tribute to his predecessor George Osborne but said he would now follow three new fiscal rules: to balance the books \"as early as possible in the next Parliament\", for public sector net debt to be falling as a share of GDP by the end of Parliament and for welfare spending to be within a cap.\nThe OBR based its forecasts on the assumption that the UK would leave the EU in April 2019 - two years after the government's deadline for triggering negotiations with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\nIt also assumed new trading arrangements would slow import and export growth for a decade and that migration would be restricted.\nIt said the increased borrowing would result from weak tax receipts and lower than expected growth predictions as a result of June's vote to leave the European Union.\nBased on its assumptions around Brexit - the government has not yet revealed the details of its negotiating plan - it predicted the referendum result would account for an extra ¬£58bn of borrowing.\nThis included a predicted ¬£16bn increase as a result of lower migration and ¬£18.1bn because of lower productivity growth.\nThe OBR said its forecasts for Brexit were \"uncertain\", and they were disputed by Conservative MP John Redwood, who said: \"Their forecast probably is too low, their borrowing forecast is far too high, and we'll get good access to the single market once we're out of the EU.\"\nThe Economists for Brexit group said the OBR had \"assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the EU, based on bad economic policy-making\".\nAt the end of his speech, Mr Hammond revealed the Autumn Statement would be scrapped in future years, saying there was no need for major tax changes to be made twice a year.\nInstead, he added to laughter from MPs, there would be a \"Spring Statement\" where the government would respond to OBR forecasts, and the Budget would take place in the Autumn. It is not clear whether that means there will be two Budgets in 2017.\nLaura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\nOuch!\nThere was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than ¬£100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly ¬£60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going.\nRemember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession.\nBut what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications.\nRead more from Laura\nThe government had already announced an extra ¬£2bn a year for science by 2020, a crackdown on compensation claims for whiplash injuries aimed at reducing motorists' insurance premiums and ¬£1.3bn to improve roads.\nChanges to Universal Credit - the flagship single payment being rolled out across the UK - will reduce the \"taper rate\" from 65% to 63%. This means benefits will be withdrawn at a rate of 63p for every pound of net earnings.\nThe government said about three million households would benefit.\nBut the Resolution Foundation think-tank said their gains would be \"small fry\" compared with previously announced cuts to the work allowance, which is the amount people can earn before they start to lose their benefits.\nOn housing, the government said it would relax rules on how affordable housing funding could be used.\nIt said banning letting agents' upfront fees would help 4.3 million private rental tenants.\nCitizens Advice welcomed measures on the agents' fees and on workers' wages but said more should be done to help \"just-managing families\".\nLabour, which has been calling for agents' fees to be banned, said: \"Any change of heart is welcome\" but added that the government had \"no plan\" to fix the housing crisis.\nResponding to Mr Hammond in the Commons, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Autumn Statement placed on record the \"abject failure of the last six years\".\nHe condemned the government's approach to austerity and said the people the prime minister promised to protect - those who are \"just about managing\" - had been \"betrayed\".\n\"After all the sacrifices people have made over the past six years, I fear today's statement has laid the foundations for more wasted years,\" he added.\nThe SNP said Mr Hammond had offered little on the \"elephant in the room\" - Brexit - while the Lib Dems said the government would \"hit people in the pocket through their hapless handling of Brexit\".\nBut UKIP said billions were being wasted by the government \"delaying\" the UK's exit from the EU.\nPlaid Cymru said there was little in the statement to help rebuild the Welsh economy and close the wage gap with England.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] But in a BBC interview, Williams cast doubt on whether the 40-year-old can win another major and suggested Woods' fitness problems might have been self-inflicted.\nNo-one knows Woods' game better than Williams, who shared in 13 of the American's 14 major titles among 84 tournament victories together.\nTheir partnership broke down in 2011 and Woods has since not added to his major tally. The former world number one last played competitively in August last year.\nWoods has slumped to 467 in the world rankings while he recovers from his latest back surgery and there seems no prospect of an imminent return.\nYet Williams is convinced the golfer can achieve more professional victories.\n\"I don't doubt he will come back to the winner's circle,\" Williams told 5 live Golf.\n\"He is a great competitor, he has an incredible work ethic - when he can work hard - and one thing he does know how to do is win.\n\"He has that ability to win even when he's not playing his best. But whether he comes back and wins major championships? That's going to be a very difficult task.\"\nThe four-times Masters champion looks certain to miss next month's Augusta gathering for only the second time since his debut as an amateur in 1995.\nWilliams was Woods' right-hand man throughout the period between 1999 and 2008 when the American dominated the game, and Williams thinks his old employer may now be regretting the way he punished his body during that spell.\n\"I guess when he looks back, he might question some of the activities that he did, some of the gym work that he might have done that, you know, had all these injuries escalate,\" he said.\nWatching from a much greater distance, it seemed to me that Woods trained as an athlete rather than as a golfer. Athletes' bodies usually break down in their late 30s, certainly in terms of enabling competition at the highest level.\nIs this what has happened? Does Williams see any worth to this argument?\n\"It is very hard to pinpoint how he has got to where he is now, but I'd have to say there is a lot merit in what you've just said,\" he said.\nWilliams was caddying for US veteran Ray Floyd in the mid-1990s when he first came across the willowy youngster who made it a career ambition to overhaul Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles.\nGreg Norman and Fred Couples were also in the group and they listened in disbelief while Woods contemplated carrying his drive over the fairway bunker down the right of Augusta's par-five second hole.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"We were laughing at him just talking about it, but then he actually did it,\" Williams recalled in the interview which publicises the caddie's recent autobiography Out of the Rough.\nTheir first major triumph came at the 1999 PGA Championship when Williams gave an accurate read for a crucial putt on the 16th hole of the final round.\n\"That was the moment between him and me that created a real, true bond and got us going,\" he said.\nEven though it was a vital putt, Williams had absolute confidence in his judgement. Indeed, he says the only time has ever been nervous caddying was in a bizarre and unrelated situation at the following year's US Open.\nThis was during Woods' epic 15-shot victory at Pebble Beach. The third round resumed early on the Sunday and Williams was unaware Woods had taken balls from his golf bag to practise his putting back at the hotel.\nIt meant they had to complete the closing half-dozen holes with only three balls in the bag. When one became scuffed and the oblivious Woods gave it to a young spectator, Williams started to panic.\nThe caddie's discomfort grew even greater when his boss drove into the ocean on the final tee, leaving just one ball left. \"Put it this way, if he'd not found the fairway with the next I'd not be here talking to you now,\" Williams smiled.\nThe notion of a smiling Williams is somewhat removed from the scowling figure who often acted as much as a bouncer as a bagman in his dealings on the course. He would aggressively silence stray camera clicks and other elements that might put off his player.\n\"I tried to give Tiger the same playing field as everyone else,\" Williams said.  \"Sometimes people send you over the edge, but it's just how it was at the time and I don't regret anything that I did.\n\"Often to the general public it wasn't acceptable,\" he continued. \"But they didn't know the full story of what was behind the scenes and what actually happened.\"\nThe same can be said of Williams' ignorance of  Woods' multiple marital affairs that signalled the golfer's downfall in 2009. \"I had no idea what was going on,\" he said.\nThese revelations ultimately put an intolerable strain on their partnership.\n\"The relationship was stretched to the max and it was never quite the same, we just didn't connect after that,\" he said.\nAs was well publicised at the time of his book's publication in New Zealand, Williams uses its pages to complain of, at times, being \"treated like a slave\" by Woods.\nThe caddie has acknowledged it was an poor choice of words, but within context this simile does feel a little more acceptable than when taken in isolation.\nAnd it is impossible to imagine him resorting to such a phrase when describing his working relationship with the amiable Scott.\nWilliams is helping the Australian at the biggest tournaments this year and the burly New Zealander inherits one of the game's form players.\nScott won twice during the recent Florida swing, including the World Golf Championship event at Doral earlier this month. Despite these successes, Scott will bench his British caddie David Clark to harness Williams' expertise at next month's Masters.\n\"Caddying for Adam has been like a breath of fresh air for me,\" said Williams, who was at Scott's side for his 2013 Augusta triumph. \"I'm really looking forward to seeing if he can win one more.\n\"I always say to Adam, many players win one major and that's great but to be recognised as one of the top players in the game... you want to have multiple majors beside your name.\"\nWilliams watches no golf on television and back home in New Zealand lives life following his two great sporting passions - rugby union and motorsport.\nBut he says he will not be off the pace when he caddies for the first time this year at the season's opening major.\n\"I'll get a feel straight away,\" he said. \"It's just fantastic, I feel really privileged to be caddying for Adam and also to know I've had some part in developing his game.\n\"Dave Clark is doing a fantastic job out there, obviously. He's a guy like myself, one of the older caddies. He's got a young family, so he'll enjoy his time away now.\n\"He'll sit back while I caddie for a few tournaments and then he can come back and caddie for a few more. It's quite a good set-up.\"\nWilliams accepts we are now in a post-Tiger era but believes golf is in great health with the likes of Scott, his compatriot Jason Day, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth leading the way.\nYou sense his enthusiasm to return to the circus and satisfy his obvious competitive edge. This quality was at the heart of the long and successful partnership with Woods.\nIt was not about the money, it was about the winning.\nBut on the subject of cash, there was one question that had to be asked: \"Were you New Zealand's highest-paid sportsman for a while there?\"\nWilliams laughed: \"I couldn't answer that question because I don't know what anyone else gets paid. I did very well out of caddying for Tiger, no-one's going to deny that.\n\"But look at the All Blacks and our other great sportsmen and I just couldn't tell you what they earn.\"\nThese days Williams certainly trails financially in the wake of Dan Carter and co, but it would be no surprise if he banks another hefty cheque upon emerging from his semi-retirement at Augusta next month.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] The message from Celtic Park, in the wake of the announcement of Ronny Deila's exit at the end of the season, was one of calm and an insistence that they know what's gone wrong and they know what needs to happen in order to fix it.\nAs chief executive, Peter Lawwell has been caught in the fallout of Sunday's loss to Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final.\nThere have been calls for his head as well as Deila's, but Lawwell is probably less likely to leave now than he has been at any point in recent times.\nLawwell - and all people in his position - think about legacy. They all want to leave on a high, serenaded out on the back of a big feel-good moment. Lawwell is not likely to have Deila as the full-stop on his years at Parkhead, even though Deila was his appointment.\nThat's where the pressure comes, though. His next decision is a monumental one - and he'd better get it right.\nIf he doesn't then you wouldn't bank on him leaving on his own terms. If he does, and a winning manager is the result, then everything else fades away - all the supporter disaffection, all the issues about stockpiling players, all of it.\nThere were huge doubts swirling around Celtic Park in the dog-days of Tony Mowbray's reign but Neil Lennon took over and took things forward. Rangers could scarcely have been at a lower ebb than a 6-1 aggregate loss to a poor Motherwell side at the end of last season but Mark Warburton, in rapid time, turned it around.\nGood managers are like that. They have a touch of magic about them - they make other problems disappear.\nThe names of possible successors are coming thick and fast - David Moyes is, by the looks of it, fluttering his eyelashes at Aston Villa and Celtic. Lennon has made it clear that he would be happy to talk about a return. Malky Mackay has already let it be known that he would love the job.\nAlan Stubbs was considered a contender in the media a few months ago, then was written off when Hibs hit the wall, and might yet be a contender again if Hibs win the Scottish Cup and get promotion to the Premiership.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNorthern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been mentioned. Roy Keane was offered the job before Deila and he's on the betting short-list again now.\nBefore this is done, there will be other names - many, many others.\nKeane's recollection of the summer of 2014 is interesting. It comes from his book, The Second Half. \"I got a call: would I go and have a chat with Dermot Desmond,\" Keane wrote about the time he was approached to succeed Lennon.\n\"At the end of the chat, [Desmond] said: \"The job is yours.' It was all pretty straightforward. There'd be one or two restrictions, about staff. They'd already picked the man who'd be my assistant, and they were insisting on him. It didn't scare me off, although it did get me thinking.\n\"It wasn't an ideal start. Were they doubting me already?\"\nOne lesson, of many, that needs to be learned is that the new manager should pick his own staff.\nKeane's story continued. \"Over the years, when chatting with people about football and Celtic, I'd always said, 'If you're offered the Celtic job, you don't turn it down'.\"\nWhen he started talking to Lawwell, though, Keane began to have doubts.\n\"I thought about the Celtic offer. It wasn't rocking my boat. They weren't convincing me - 'Listen, you're the man for us.'\"\nKeane concluded that had there been a bit of what he called \"give and take\", then it might have been different. \"Celtic didn't give me enough of a headache,\" he wrote. \"They just didn't show me that they wanted me.\"\nIt's a moot point about whether Keane would have been any good as Celtic manager, but if that's the manager Desmond wanted then the pursuit of him of was strangely lukewarm.\nThey ended up with a young and compliant manager, a worthwhile gamble but a punt that has led them to this point.\nCeltic's negotiations with their number one choice would need to be a whole lot more convincing this time around.\nThe situation that they're in now is not dissimilar to the one that Lennon inherited post-Mowbray. Against Rangers - and in too many matches preceding Sunday - Celtic looked like a team existing on reputation alone, tired champions vulnerable to the challenge of hungrier opponents.\nLawwell has been pelted with flak but this one is on Deila.\nCeltic have a battalion of players and, in relative terms, a lavishly assembled squad, but they were sent out on to the field in poor shape.\nThere is an argument - and it's hard to disagree with it - that if Warburton had switched hats, magic or otherwise, and was Celtic's manager, with all those players at his disposal, then the result would have been very different.\nWhen it comes to auditing Deila's time as Celtic manager the ledger is lopsided, the debits outweighing the credits to such a vast extent that the Norwegian could have no legitimate excuses when the announcement came.\nYou have to mine the records pretty thoroughly to find the marquee results on Deila's watch. In truth, there wasn't a single one that made you go 'Wow!' There were moments of optimism domestically, but that's a given when you're Celtic manager.\nIn Europe - what Celtic like to think of as their true testing ground - they have gone hurtling backwards.\nThere has been a haplessness in the transfer market that further undermined his position as Celtic manager. The hierarchy at the club have denied, on several occasion, that players were signed for Deila. They say that all players who came in did so with his approval. If that's the case then the charge sheet against him is a long one.\nCeltic have lost their way, that's obvious. They have given game-time to 34 players in the Premiership this season. Leicester's number, by comparison, is 23.\nNo side in the top three of any of the major leagues in Europe have used anything like Celtic's number in their domestic league. The average is 24.\nOf course, these clubs can afford to buy ready-made players, dependable talents who don't need to be developed. It's easy enough to operate with a smaller group of players if you're shelling out multiple millions on most of them.\nCeltic are supposed to be all about development. Fine. Their counterparts might be PSV and Ajax and Feyenoord from the Netherlands or Benfica, Sporting Lisbon and Porto from Portugal or Bruges and Gent from Belgium. Gent made the last 16 of the Champions League.\nNone of those teams have used as many players in their league as Celtic have this season. PSV have used 23, Ajax 25, Feyenoord 22.\nThe strange irony is that for all their bodies at Celtic Park they are ludicrously thin on strikers - effectively they have just one - and, also, some of the talented young players they're wanting to develop have barely featured. Scott Allan has had one start. Ryan Christie hasn't even had one.\nA good manager can bring clarity to all of this. Finding him is the challenge. Celtic's gamble on Deila has failed. They cannot afford to fail again.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

We have a important Nations Cup qualifier against Liberia in June.\n\"I don't like the term 'star player' because when you see a star in the sky it is completely dark around it. I prefer a player to be like the sun, shining light on all the people around them. Star players belong in individual sport, not in football. I will try to explain this to him.\"\nWhile the immediate task is to try to get Adebayor on side, LeRoy realises that there is much work to be done to ensure a new group of Togolese players will come through to take the place of the 32-year-old and others reaching the end of their career.\n\"Togo has a lot of good young players but we have to solve some problems,\" said LeRoy, who has coached in Africa for over 30 years and is familiar with the problems at grassroots level on the continent.\n\"I told the Togo FA we need to work on improving local football in the country.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] That is, the credo pushed by successive presidents that the United States is a beacon of democracy, an exemplar of human rights, an indispensable country imbued with special values and beliefs that grants it the moral authority and national self-belief to influence and admonish other countries, friend and foe alike.\nDonald Trump, rather than being heralded as the leader of free world, has been pilloried. By protesters who took to the streets - and snow - from Australia to Antarctica as part of more than 600 protests worldwide on the first weekend of his presidency.\nBy satirists who came up with the \"Netherlands Second\" viral video - and all its other cheeky iterations - in response to Trump's \"America First\" doctrine.\nBy models at Milan Fashion Week who paraded on the catwalk wearing the now iconic pink pussy hats that first appeared on the Washington Mall at the massive women's march.\nBy graphic designers who have created a gallery of scolding magazine covers, including, most shockingly, Der Spiegel's depiction of the US president holding aloft the severed head of the Statue of Liberty.\nWhen Jimmy Kimmel joked during his Oscars opening monologue that Donald Trump had made 225 countries hate America, he was exaggerating. As with all well-aimed satire, however, it contained more than a kernel of truth.\nIt is a measure of Trump's unpopularity that George W Bush, the last US president to attract such international ire, is being rehabilitated in the global mind as a cool-headed statesman and staunch defender of American press freedom.\nLast year, at the height of the presidential campaign, a Pew Research Center poll suggested that 85% of Europeans have \"no confidence\" in Donald Trump to do the right thing as president.\nA poll conducted by Gallup International Association suggested that, were the US election to be held in 45 foreign countries, Hillary Clinton would have won a landslide victory in every single one, with the sole exception of Russia. The French President Francois Hollande even said the brash billionaire made people \"want to retch\".\nThough international leaders are now more respectful, few could be described as being genuinely admiring. It will take more than his speech before the joint session of Congress, in which Trump sought to stabilise his presidency, to assuage global concerns.\nDuring his inaugural address, Donald Trump paid lip service to the notion of American exceptionalism, though he did not use the phrase.\n\"We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example,\" he declared. \"We will shine for everyone to follow.\"\nBut rather than painting a picture of sunny American uplands, his inaugural address sketched out something darker and more dystopian: a country marred by poverty-stricken and crime-ridden inner cities and \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape\".\nThe speech will be remembered not for his brief invocation of American exceptionalism, but rather his depiction of \"American carnage\" and his pledge to put \"America First.\" It was bunker America rather than beacon America.\nIn his speech to the joint session of Congress, there was another perfunctory acknowledgment of exceptionalism thinking when he said the \"torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world.\"\nBut although softer in tone than his angry inaugural, Tuesday night's address was stridently nationalistic nonetheless. \"My job is not to represent the world,\" he affirmed. \"My job is to represent the United States of America.\"\nDonald Trump has already signalled he believes that America can be great without it being exceptional. In a jaw-dropping interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News broadcast on Super Bowl Sunday, Trump seemed to reject the central tenet of exceptionalist thinking: that American values are the global gold standard.\nAsked why he favoured closer ties with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom O'Reilly characterised as \"a killer\", Trump responded: \"There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\"\nFor critics, it implied a moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, a country that in recent years has annexed Crimea, been accused of murdering internal opponents, allegedly committed war crimes in Syria and severely curtailed LGBT rights.\nDonald Trump also appears to set more store in hard power, the use and threat of force, than soft power, the use of more subtle forms of suasion such as diplomacy and international aid.\nJust look at this week's budget proposal, which calls for an almost 10% splurge on defence spending to be paid for in part by cuts to State Department funding and international aid. Promoting human rights abroad, a central tenet of the exceptionalist creed, no longer appears to be an urgent priority.\nThe United States is even said to be considering withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council, partly because of what it perceives as UN bias against Israel.\nActing on another exceptionalist impulse, America has traditionally championed press freedom around the world. The First Amendment resonates way beyond these shores.\nBut with Donald Trump continuing to rage against the US media in an attempt, seemingly, to delegitimise it, America's clarion voice on press freedom has at best been compromised and at worst been rendered mute.\nRather than wanting America to be emulated, it would appear that Trump prefers it to be feared. And although local criticism, from media organisations like the New York Times, lays bare his thin skin, international criticism seems almost to have an emboldening effect.\nIf other countries are railing against him, it is a sign he is doing his job and delivering on his campaign promises.\nIt brings to mind the famed chant heard from the stands of Millwall FC, one of the least fashionable clubs in the English football league: \"No-one likes us, we don't care.\"\nRight now, it's American adulation that he seems to crave more than global admiration.\nTo many international ears, American exceptionalism has long sounded like bogus boosterism, a vain conceit.\nWhat right did a country that countenanced slavery and the racial apartheid of Jim Crow have to lecture others?\nEven in World War Two, when America became the \"arsenal of the democracy\" in the defeat of fascism, it was a segregated US military that took to the battlefield.\nVietnam, Watergate, Guantanamo Bay, the Iraq war and electronic eavesdropping. To foreign critics, American exceptionalism doubles as American hypocrisy.\nBarack Obama sought to revive the concept after the Bush years, when America's global stock was low, and regularly spoke of exceptionalism. Under his presidency, however, it continued to have negative connotations. America was exceptional because of its high rates of gun crime, its multiple killings and its racial flare-ups.\nRebels in Syria wondered why the Obama administration wasn't doing more to help it oust a murderous despot like Bashar al-Assad. Moreover, Guantamano Bay, a US landmark that loomed larger in the post-911 era than the Statue of Liberty in many Muslim countries, remained open.\nUS democracy was also widely seen as falling into disrepute, because of the dysfunction in Washington, the rise of hyper-partisan oppositional politics and the anger that poisoned the entire polity.\nThe 2016 presidential campaign, pitting two such deeply unpopular candidates against each other in a hugely uninspiring contest, presented an ugly shop window. The Electoral College, for those unversed in its intricacies and anomalies, also seemed demonstrably undemocratic.\nHow could Donald Trump emerge the victor, they asked, when Hillary Clinton received almost three million more votes?\nAmerican exceptionalism was looking shaky even before Donald Trump took the oath of office.\nA key difference is that Barack Obama continued until his final days to talk of building a more perfect union, an aspiration that sprung from his exceptionalist ethos, while Donald Trump continues to talk of building that wall along the Mexican border.\nOver the centuries, what has set US global leadership apart from the European powers that used to dominate the world is a fundamental difference in national mindset: America came to believe it was born to lead rather than born to rule.\nHaving won its independence from an imperial power, it sought to colonise the planet with its values and ideas rather than building a territorial empire.\nEver since Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought America into the war, the assertion of global leadership, and the promulgation of its ideas that goes with it, has been deemed central to the national self-interest.\nBut Trumpism, with its narrower homeland focus, looks like making a definitive break from this past.\nHis planned wall could end up serving as the metaphor for his presidency.\nTrump's America might end up being a forcefully protected citadel, but will it be a city on a hill?", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Instead you wanted it all for yourself,\" the judge said.\n\"I am firmly of the view that you currently pose a real danger to women with whom you form a relationship,\" Judge Bright QC said.\nMs Bailey penned the Electra Brown series of teen novels, and was also praised for her blog - Planet Grief - in which she talked about the death of her husband John Sinfield.\n\"The world has lost a gifted author and her family and friends will have to live the rest of their lives with the deep sense of loss your wicked crime has inflicted upon them,\" the judge told Stewart.\nAs a result of the case, detectives are now re-examining the death of Stewart's wife Diane, who died after an epileptic seizure at the couple's home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.\nStewart, who refused to appear via videolink from prison, was also found guilty of preventing Ms Bailey's lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice.\nHe had denied murder, claiming two men called Nick and Joe had kidnapped Ms Bailey in April last year and blackmailed him for √Ç¬£500,000.\nBut jurors took just over six hours to convict him after hearing seven weeks of evidence.\nSimon Russell Flint, defending, said during his mitigation: \"The likelihood is, given his state of health, the sentence has a like-effect of a whole-life order.\n\"There is every prospect and likelihood Mr Stewart will end his days behind bars.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Despite being renowned for its beauty queens, the South American nation is in the throes of economic collapse after years of fiscal mismanagement, and this has caused the cost of looking good to spiral out of control.\nApart from that anomaly, the price gap is much as you would expect. The countries where the cost of beauty is higher tend to be in regions that have a higher cost of living in general, such as northern Europe and North America.\nAfter Venezuela, the most expensive countries for cosmetic products and services are Switzerland, Norway, Denmark and Finland, with Australia, Sweden and the US close behind.\nThe cheapest places after Vietnam are India, South Africa, Thailand and Egypt. The Czech Republic, Colombia and Panama also score well.\nThe UK comes in on the pricey side, ranking 36th cheapest out of the 50 nations surveyed.\n\"We hope that our index helps people more confidently interpret variations in costs associated with beauty around the world,\" said Linio's chief executive, Andreas Mjelde.\n\"Increasingly, the average citizen is a global one, and with a better understanding of global markets comes empowerment to travel, shop and live smarter.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It could be as low as four or five, or as many as 100 - it's hard to say,\" he tells the BBC.\nAnd social media content has to be tailored to suit the cultural differences - not to mention the available internet speeds - of fans in different countries, he adds.\nThe key, says Mr Chatterjee, is keeping fans engaged between matches, given that 95% of them will never enter the stadium.\nThis could mean enabling team sponsors to run competitions and offer prizes, as well as offering the usual game and player stats, and \"build your own team\" functionality.\nIn another example, he says all the data being collected from the players - their fitness levels and running speed - could be incorporated into apps for wearable devices, allowing fans to test their own fitness against that of their favourite players.\n\"But if I could imagine how a fan will be interacting with the club in five years time then I've already failed,\" Mr Chatterjee concludes.\n\"We're on an exciting journey, so let's get a lot of ideas on the table and do things no other club has ever done.\"\nThe interaction doesn't always have to be very hi-tech, however.\nMr Arnold says that simply giving fans the ability to wish players happy birthday on social media \"turned out to be one of the most engaging pieces of content you can do\".\nHCL will be setting up a \"United Xperience Lab\" at the Man Utd's Old Trafford stadium, where it will \"explore revolutionary ways in which the club uses technology to create a unified fan experience for supporters...\", according to the jargon-filled press release.\nThe technical challenge of providing that \"unified experience\" for millions of fans across 200 countries and in 27 languages is \"mind boggling\", Mr Arnold admits.\nSo HCL's chief executive Anant Gupta says the first task is \"about creating a scalable, robust, industrialised platform√¢‚Ç¨¬¶\". The content will come as a result of focus groups and feedback from fans, according to HCL, but video is likely to play a big part.\nThe difficulty of providing streaming video to mobile devices of varying quality, across multiple networks of varying speeds and capacities, is formidable, believes Merrick Kingston, principal analyst at media and technology consultancy, IHS.\n\"It sounds boring to talk about the nuts and bolts of video, but online distribution of high-quality streaming video is very expensive,\" he says, \"and optimising your system to enable bitrates that can adapt to different network conditions in different countries is a huge undertaking.\"\nSo is HCL up to the task?\nMan Utd were certainly keen to stress HCL's financial strength, trumpeting its $1bn (√Ç¬£655m) net profit figure on $6bn of revenue, perhaps reflecting anxiety that many people in the sports business world may not have heard of the IT services company.\nHCL operates in 31 countries across the globe, and specialises in forming partnerships with other IT companies, such as Microsoft, Cisco, SAP, Hewlett-Packard and EMC.\nThat said, Mr Kingston admits: \"They're not the type of firm I'd have expected to see in this type of deal.\"\nOf course, the main reason for deeper digital engagement with fans is to make more money for the club.\nMore interaction means greater advertising and merchandising opportunities among its largely young and affluent fanbase.\nMr Arnold says: \"There's a virtuous circle that comes from enhanced engagement, which translates into more and deeper fan activation, which translates into financial success, which allows us to invest on the pitch, which gives us success.\n\"And that leads you right back in the circle to the work we're doing engaging with those fans and driving it on.\"\nAnd Man Utd isn't alone in spotting this potential digital dividend.\nIn July, arch rival Manchester City announced a tie-up with German software giant SAP, as part of a drive to share match-day and training data with fans, and generally enhance interaction.\nAnd last week Chelsea announced a deal with Wipro, another Indian IT services company, citing reasons similar to those given by Man Utd.\nChristian Purslow, Chelsea's managing director, said: \"We plan on using this partnership to truly enhance the fan experience for millions of Chelsea supporters worldwide.\"\nWill 50 million of those fans in India, a tie-up with an Indian IT company would seem to make commercial sense.\nBut will these clubs succeed in providing content their fans want to see and pay for?\nLet the digital games begin.\nFollow Matthew on Twitter: @matthew_wall", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

She was attacked when she went to defecate in the open, a way of life for most of these villagers.\nHer parents did not press any charges even though they knew who did it. In fact  many villagers told me he had been accused of another rape in the village.\n\"The girl needs to be married off in a few years,\" one of her relatives said.\nFinding a suitable groom would be hard if her rape was made public, virginity being an essential criteria for marriage in such rural societies.\nThe girl and her parents - who don't want to be identified - have found solace in anonymity and the sympathy they get from their relations and friends.\nEven with all that support, they have not been able to confront the rapist. Apparently, bringing the culprit to justice would mean going public.\nIt isn't worth the pain for them. The girl who now studies in a college wants to move on and heal while keeping quiet.\nBandana Bagdi, a landless farmer's wife,  says she was accosted in the same village.\n\"I could have been raped, but I ran away,\" she says, in her ramshackle hut by a pond.\nWhen, along with her husband and brothers, she went to confront the culprit she was turned away by the villagers.\n\"They said I was a bad woman after a good man,\" she says. Traditional rural societies, such as here, are swift to put the blame on the victim.\nIn remote Kelai village, Golechera Bewa, 60, feels helpless. Her youngest daughter Ajida Khatun, 19, was coming home at dusk past a deserted stretch when a man tried to drag her in a corner. Ajida ran to save herself.\nGoing to the police would be \"too much [of a] trouble\" for an \"illiterate, poor old woman\", she said. The village council was an option, but going there would give the girl a \"bad name\".\nMs Bewa says: \"Honour is the only thing that we have. Without that we can't live in these villages.\"\nSome of her hesitation comes from the fact that the perpetrator is well-off, making her feel powerless. With men going to the Middle East for manual labour, there has been an influx of money and that has changed power dynamics in the area.\nThe \"new money\" has caused arrogance, says Rajib Lochan Roy, a lawyer in the area who has represented several rape victims.\n\"There's a tendency to justify the bad behaviour through money and power,\" he says.\nHe says it is like the old times, when \"the feudal lords would assert their will on the women belonging to the economically weaker sections\".\nOften, such cases are privately settled with money, never making it to the police record.\nLike individual honour, the honour of a village is also a reason rapes are not reported. Villages here are connected by marriages and bloodlines through generations.\nIf a case is filed, the reputation of a whole community might be at stake.\nThis creates pressure from within the community to hush up the incidents; if it is kept silent there will be no public controversy and the peace will be kept.\nThe case of Bapi Das's wife was a disturbing one.  The police recorded it as a case of consensual sex followed by murder.\nBut the post-mortem report contradicted this, saying it was a case of forced sex. Bapi Das is now pursuing a petition with the Human Rights Commission in Delhi and Calcutta seeking justice.\nA local citizens' human rights group that helped Mr Das to file the petitions feels that the police are under political pressure to undercount cases of rapes.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

All but three of the UK's top universities achieved higher citation rates than last year, though they still trail the big US institutions like Harvard, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\"There are now three sets of international rankings for universities - all of them use citations among their main measures. Leading universities are increasingly aware of their international position and academics always want to produce research that is cited by others. American academics tend to cite other Americans, which gives them an edge.\n\"Increasing the number of academic citations is one of the ways that UK universities have improved this year, but they also do very well in most of the other measures including their reputations amongst other academics.\n\"UK universities genuinely have a very high reputation all over the world.\"\nCambridge University, now in second place, was top of the whole table in the two preceding years.

By 2011-12 that number had grown to 11,000, a move Mr O'Leary said would have brought in more international students and boosted both the university's income and the effectiveness of its research.\nMr O'Leary said teaching in English also gave UK universities a big advantage, particularly in attracting international students. He added: \"Per dollar, the UK has for sometime had the most productive university system in the world.\"\nDr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research universities, said: \"It is important to nurture leading research universities within a genuinely diverse education system where a range of institutions with different missions and strengths are fostered.\n\"The country does not need - and certainly cannot afford - all universities to be research-intensive.\n\"In these difficult economic times, our institutions have made every pound work hard. Against the odds, with 1% of the world's population, 14% of the world's most highly-cited papers come from UK-based research.\n\"We can strengthen this effect by prioritising research funding where it will have the most impact.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

He was due to be executed this week, but the date has been put off while India's president considers a mercy plea.\nIts gate is blocked by police barriers, and life in the street outside carries on as normal.\nThere is a man selling water melons, another herding cattle. Signs on the gates of the neighbouring mansions show that lawyers, doctors and other professionals live there.\nThe deaths were discovered in December 2006 after body parts and children's clothing were found blocking the sewer running in front of the house.\nKoli worked in D5 as a servant for the owner, Monindher Pandher, who was a businessman. In the five cases which have so far gone to trial, Pandher has been let off due to a lack of evidence, but is still in jail facing other charges. He says he is innocent.\nThe murders caused an outcry because they seemed to exemplify the divisions that still exist in India despite its economic miracle.\nThe killings took place in a wealthy Delhi suburb but the victims came from families that had migrated from the countryside. The families accused the police of ignoring their pleas for help in tracking down their missing children because they were poor.\nThey lived in a slum, Nithari, which backed onto the house.

They asked me why I was bothering with such matters.\"\nAfter the first corpses were discovered the residents became so furious that they attacked the police. A senior officer denied to me at the time that they had ignored the complaints, but later six policemen were suspended.\nAccording to Ushaa Thakur, the case reflects extremely badly on her country.\n\"India is in a very miserable state. People are just not bothered, and even if they are, they don't want to waste time on such things, on poor people, on the people who are crying,\" she said.\nBut at least the killings forced politicians and the police to promise to do more about the scandal of India's missing children.\nA recent report found that about 60,000 disappear across the country every year.

But how good is the Cabinet Office's own record on handling FOI requests?\nNew data obtained by the BBC shows a big increase in complaints to the information commissioner about Cabinet Office slowness.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has disclosed that the number of Cabinet Office delay cases which were not previously reported amounted to 90 in the two years 2013/4 and 2014/5. That's more than three times the comparable figure of 29 in the previous two years.\nThis is on top of the smaller number of investigations which have led to the ICO publicly issuing formal decision notices.\nIt is the latest evidence of the historically poor track record of the Cabinet Office, which has twice been subject to special monitoring by the ICO due to its inadequate performance on processing FOI applications. It's possible that the Cabinet Office may now face this for a third time.\n\"In the last two months or so we've issued six decision notices against the Cabinet Office for exceeding the statutory time limit - it's not a good record,\" says Graham Smith, the deputy information commissioner.\nAs well as obtaining direct control over freedom of information policy, the Cabinet Office has also taken over the \"clearing house\" from the Ministry of Justice. This is the team of officials who advise other government departments on how to handle sensitive FOI cases.\n\"The Cabinet Office should be setting a good example to the rest of Whitehall,\" Smith adds. \"You would hope that they would want to be an exemplar\".\nA few days ago the ICO also rebuked the Cabinet Office for failing to comply properly with an investigation.  A decision notice reported that the commissioner was \"extremely disappointed\" he had to serve a formal notice on the Cabinet Office to get cooperation.\nHowever the ICO itself is often criticised and sometimes derided by those who feel that for political reasons it fails to take a tough enough stance over the Cabinet Office's failings. Some who believe this are FOI officers in other public authorities.\nIn June the commissioner issued an enforcement notice against the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, instructing it to deal with its extensive backlog of unanswered FOI requests.\nBut Smith told the ICO press office not to issue a press release announcing this measure, because it would \"provoke more questions and comment about lack of action against others, notably the Cabinet Office\".\nThis document was revealed following an FOI request to the ICO by the information law consultant, Tim Turner.\nSmith says he does not feel any embarrassment at this disclosure. He argues that the specific legal and practical circumstances for an enforcement notice to be issued do not exist in the case of the Cabinet Office.\nHis reasons for dropping the press release simply reflected the facts of life, he says: \"We know how these things are talked about\".\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson commented: \"The transfer of FOI policy to Cabinet Office fits with our lead on cross-Whitehall issues and our lead on wider transparency. It is acknowledged that because of the nature of the Cabinet Office our cases are generally of greater complexity and sensitivity.\"\nThe Cabinet Office also argues that in most instances the ICO's adjudications support their refusal to provide requested information. However their analysis ignores numerous rulings where the Commissioner has upheld complaints about the Cabinet Office failing to respond in good time or to provide requesters with assistance as the law requires.\nI should declare an interest as someone who has made FOI requests to the Cabinet Office and assisted colleagues in doing so.

He is very positive, always thinks of any situation as an opportunity.\n\"I don't know what captaincy would do to that. Captaincy is not just about handling 10 more guys, or having a squad and interacting with the management.\n\"It comes with the whole package of interacting with the media, having people expect things from you in a very different way, having the onus of the whole country on your shoulders as far as the sport is concerned.\n\"Joe looks like a guy who has got the temperament to do it but you can only tell well he gets into the scheme of things and how he reacts to it.\"\nIndia are top of the ICC Test rankings after five series wins in a row and are unbeaten in 17 matches in the longer format of the game.\nThey have beaten England, New Zealand and South Africa at home, while winning in West Indies and Sri Lanka.\n\"We still understand we have got a lot of cricket to play around the world,\" said Kohli. \"It's not only about this one period we are going through.\n\"It looks really good because we have come out of transition and immediately started winning games but I wouldn't take it as a thing for over-confidence.\n\"It's an on-going process which needs to be sustained for the next seven, eight years for us to become a top-quality side and leave a mark on world cricket, maybe become known as one of the best teams to have been assembled.\n\"We want to do it across formats and make that mark for Indian cricket on the world stage.\n\"We don't feel invincible to be honest.

The Royal Navy flagship had sailed the English Channel overnight at the head of an international task group of ships.\nFor former Royal Marine Corporal Bill Bryant, 89, the sight of the beaches brought back emotional recollections of the same time exactly 70 years ago, as he prepared to drive his landing craft to the shores - carrying his colleagues to their fate on land, amid a barrage of noise and chaos.\nThe contrast with today could not have been greater as he joined many other veterans on \"Gold\" Beach, amid a festival atmosphere.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Thirty years ago, the boy from the Gellideg estate challenged Mexican Lupe Pintor for his WBC Bantamweight belt.\nDespite defying the odds to dominate the early stages of the fight, he was knocked out in the 12th round, never to regain consciousness again.\nIn a typically hard-fought battle for life, he survived for another two months, but on 4 November 1980, Johnny Owen eventually succumbed to his terrible head injuries.\nBorn to a large Merthyr family, Johnny soon learned to stick up for himself, and started his interest in boxing aged just eight.\nHe was to remain in the amateur sport until he was 20, an unusually long time by modern standards; winning 106 of his 124 bouts.\nHe fought for Wales 17 times, and was victorious on 15 occasions.\nYet despite this impressive record, Merthyr boxing writer and professional referee, Winford Jones, says that Johnny's true talent didn't lie in the shorter format of the sport.\n\"Johnny was a machine. His great skill wasn't his strength - though he never took a backwards step and could punch as hard as anyone of his weight - it was his stamina.\n\"He could fight for hours, and would wear opponents down by outlasting them.  You could see this talent far more in 12 and 15-round professional fights, than you could in the three rounds allowed in amateur boxing.\"\nHis professional career lasted just four years, from 1976 to 1980, but in that time Johnny Owen crammed in 28 fights; winning 25, drawing one and losing two.\nThough in a sense it is possible to argue that he never lost fair and square.\nHis first defeat came against Spain's Juan Francisco Rodriguez, in a fight for the European belt.\nIn what's now widely regarded by experts to have been a travesty of a home-town decision, the judges awarded Rodriguez a fight which Owen had clearly bossed.\nHis second, and final defeat came in the fatal clash with Pintor, a  fight in which he at least held his own, and may have won, were it not for the head injuries which he'd sustained.\nBut at one stage Owen's record read 22-0, winning his first fight against a former Welsh champion, George Sutton.\nIn his sixth fight he again saw off Sutton to claim the Welsh title.\nBy bout nine he had the British belt, beating Paddy Maguire, and in November 1978 he became the Commonwealth champion, stopping Italian-Australian Paul Ferreri.\nOwen wasted no time in avenging the controversial defeat to Rodriguez in the spring of 1979.\nJust a year later he convincingly bettered him in a re-match in Ebbw Vale, setting up his World title chance against Pintor.\nWinford Jones was lucky enough to referee some of those early fights.\n\"In what I think must have been his fourth or fifth fight, I remember he was taking on an Irish lad, and I had to stop it in the fourth round because Johnny was murdering him.\n\"It makes you think about what happened a few years later on to Johnny.\n\"But he was fearless, you could tell, even then, that he had the makings of a champion, and sadly the potential to get hurt, because he would never give in, and never take a backward step in a fight.\"\nYet the man who was so fearless in the ring, was the shyest and most awkward of characters in the glare of the media.\nProfessional life\nInconceivable in modern boxing, Owen would simply shake hands with his opponent at a weigh-in, avoiding confrontation, and usually conversation of any kind.\nHe declined requests for all but a tiny handful of interviews.  Perhaps boxing journalist Hugh McIlvanney summed it up best, when he wrote: \"The tragedy of Johnny Owen was that he was only articulate in the most deadly of languages.\"\nWhen Owen was knocked down in the ninth round of the WBC title-challenge in Los Angeles, it was the first time he'd been on the canvas in his professional life.\nBut he was to go down twice more in the 12th round, never getting up from the second.\nThe legacy of Johnny Owen lives on in Merthyr.\nAfter he died, a √Ç¬£100,000 relief fund raised for his care, went instead, according to his family's wishes, to establish a special-care baby unit at the town's Prince Charles Hospital.\nImportant safety lessons were learned, when it became evident from his post mortum, that Johnny had been born with a critical weakness of his skull.\nWhilst boxing will never be entirely safe, the routine scans introduced following Johnny's death, have undoubtedly saved many other lives.\nRather than bitterness, his family extended a hand of friendship and solidarity in boxing to Lupe Pintor, telegraphing him shortly after Johnny's death, to urge him not to feel guilty, and to continue boxing.\nMutual respect\nIn 2002, on the 22nd anniversary of Owen's death, his father Dick unveiled a statue of his son in Merthyr, arm-in-arm with Pintor.\nWinford Jones said was it was one of the most moving experiences of his life.\n\"Before the unveiling, I asked Lupe, in my scratchy Spanish, how he was finding the day, and he replied 'Very awkward'.\n\"But he'd come nevertheless, and the people of Merthyr gave him a tremendous reception.  I think that speaks volumes for Merthyr, and in particular for Lupe and Dick.\"\n\"I cried when I saw them hug in front of Johnny's statue.\n\"That is an image that all boxers should be shown before they set a toe in a ring, as it encapsulated the honour and mutual respect that should always be present in the sport.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Former students say they were misled by adverts claiming Mr Trump had \"hand-picked\" teachers and \"overseen\" the curriculum. The billionaire businessman continues to maintain the majority of his customers were satisfied with the real estate programme.\nThe documents were released following an order by US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The judge ruled that the files were in the public interest since Mr Trump had become \"the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race\".\nTrump University was launched in 2004 as a business venture under the Trump brand, offering courses in entrepreneurship. The extent of Mr Trump's involvement in the scheme is a key point on contention.\nThe trove of documents include manuals or \"playbooks\" for employees outlining how to \"close the deal\" and convince students to invest in business seminars that cost up to nearly $35,000 (√Ç¬£24,288).\nThe \"playbooks\" also advised sales staff on how to speak to reporters, how to dress and run Trump University events, as well as how to identify students with the most liquid assets.\nThe unsealed files also included depositions from executives describing how the operation worked.\nThey also included statements from employees describing the program a \"scam\". Former staff member Ronald Schnackenberg wrote that he left Trump University in 2007, citing the program used \"misleading, fraudulent and dishonest\" tactics.\nThe previously unseen testimony from Trump University executives goes some way to show Mr Trump's level of involvement in the school's marketing strategy. Michael Sexton, Trump University president, said in a 2012 deposition that Mr Trump offered \"very good and substantive input\" to the program's marketing materials.\nThe documents were released in one of two class-action lawsuits in California against Trump University.\nIn a separate civil lawsuit in New York, Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has alleged that Trump University used deceptive practices and misled students about the support they would get. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\nA judge has said the $40m case in New York could proceed to trial, but Mr Trump has appealed the ruling.\nThe San Diego case involving the released documents is expected to go to trial in late November, just weeks after the US presidential election.

It is the party of hope, ready to take on a Government hell-bent on making life worse for ordinary people.\"\nSNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Corbyn and offered to work with him to oppose the renewal of Trident nuclear weapons and against \"Tory austerity\".\nBut she added: \"The reality today is that at a time when the country needs strong opposition to the Tories, Jeremy Corbyn leads a deeply, and very bitterly, divided party.\n\"Indeed, if Labour cannot quickly demonstrate that they have a credible chance of winning the next UK general election, many more people in Scotland are likely to conclude that independence is the only alternative to continued Tory government.\"\nThe prime minister spoke to Mr Corbyn on the phone to congratulate him on becoming the new leader of the opposition.\nBut Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, giving the Conservative Party's reaction, said: \"Labour are now a serious risk to our nation's security, our economy's security and your family's security.\n\"Whether it's weakening our defences, raising taxes on jobs and earnings, racking up more debt and welfare or driving up the cost of living by printing money - Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will hurt working people.\"\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood congratulated Mr Corbyn but said his election \"cannot alter Labour's dismal record in government in Wales\".\nGreen Party leader Natalie Bennett said: \"The selection of Jeremy Corbyn, combined with the remarkable Green surge of the past year, and the SNP's success at the general election, shows how many people support an alternative to austerity economics.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

His task: to keep his emotions under control and focus on the job of firing nine-time winners Madrid into the Champions League quarter finals.\nIt was all about concentration. Ronaldo never once looked up at the vast Sir Alex Ferguson stand over his left shoulder as he practised shooting from 20 yards just to the left of centre - and finding the net every time.\nWarm-ups done and it was time for team embraces. High-fives all round. Madrid's players were as one and after a few stretching routines to finish, it was time to head back for the Special One's final instructions - the final team talk from Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho.\nRonaldo emerged again at 19:41 GMT. This time the atmosphere was hot, red hot.  And at 19:44 there was a special moment as the PA announcer ran through the team line-ups. \"And it's a special welcome back to number seven Cristiano Ronaldo,\" he boomed.\nRonaldo waved, thumped his chest, waved again. His head bowed for a respectful moment before putting his hand back on to his chest. Just for a moment, those emotions must have threatened to run away from him.\nAnd the Manchester United support welcomed him back with a standing ovation which lasted until after referee Cuneyt Cakir started the match.\nUnited had the better of the first half and largely managed to shackle Ronaldo.\nWhen Sergio Ramos steered the ball into his own net to give the home side a 1-0 lead on the night, Old Trafford erupted and Ronaldo's head went down. He looked momentarily forlorn.\nAnd then the match changed irreversibly. Nani was shown a contentious red card for a high challenge on Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa.\nFurious United manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned cheerleader from the touchline while Ronaldo - knowing the Red Devils were vulnerable - immediately switched to a more central role.\nIt was emotional, it was unbelievable. I don't have words to explain what I feel\nWith attack-minded midfielder Luka Modric on for right-back Arbeloa, there was much more room for Ronaldo and Real Madrid set about exposing the 10 men of United.\nWhen Modric struck with a dipping, 25-yard equaliser, Ronaldo did not celebrate. He was far away to the left and not involved in the move. Three minutes later, he would be.\nAlmost inevitably, it was Ronaldo who secured Madrid's victory when he squeezed Gonzalo Higuain's cross in at the far post to silence the United fans. He held his arms half up above his head, knowing he had just broken 70,000 hearts.\nRonaldo could have added to his two goals in the two legs, but David de Gea twice denied him a fairytale hat-trick on the night.\nThe final whistle brought agony for United and mixed emotions for Ronaldo, who hugged Nemanja Vidic and Wayne Rooney before receiving another rapturous ovation from the United supporters near the players' tunnel.\nThis was Ronaldo's 18th Champions League match at Old Trafford.

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] About half of trusts provided details of cancellations one to three days before admission.\nHospitals must record cancellations on the day of an operation or of admission - but not those prior to that.\nBut Ipswich Hospital has now said it will start keeping records of earlier cancellations.\nNHS England said official figures showed less than 1% of operations were cancelled at the last minute.\nBy Caroline Parkinson, Health editor, BBC News website\nThese figures shine a light on a hidden issue. Hospitals don't have to record these early non-medical cancellations, so the data provided by these 74 hospitals is the only indication we have of the extent of the problem.\nThere is a view that the more notice a patient gets of a cancellation the better, because it allows more time to rearrange plans.\nBut if operations are cancelled outside the official period, patients don't have the same rights to a date for their rescheduled operation.\nOf course, sometimes patients themselves cancel an operation at the last minute.\nAnd while very few hospitals had that data, the information from those that did suggest it could be a bigger problem than hospitals cancelling themselves.\nOfficial NHS England figures show about 7.7 million planned operations were carried out in England last year.\nThere were 71,370 last-minute cancellations - either on the day the patient was meant to arrive, after they had arrived or on the day the operation was meant to take place.\nIn each case, NHS rules say a patient should be offered a new date within 28 days.\nIf that deadline is missed, hospitals are not paid for the operation, and it is recorded in official figures.\nHowever, operations cancelled outside of the official definition are not subject to the same rules.\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the definition of last-minute cancellations is wider - and is taken over several days.\nThe BBC asked all 156 NHS trusts in England, via a Freedom of Information request, to provide figures for operations cancelled one to three days before a patient was due to be admitted.\nSeventy-four provided data suggesting they had cancelled 41,474 operations within that period - as opposed to 33,400 last-minute cancellations recorded for the same trusts in the official figures.\nIona Hevican from Cornwall waited a year for a planned hysterectomy operation, which was cancelled three times before it went ahead.\nShe told the BBC: \"Every time they give you a date to go in for your operation there's a lot of preparing before you go in for that date, so any cancellation that you get is obviously a very traumatic time because of all the plans that you made, all your mindset, everything.\n\"Then just to say come back tomorrow, like you're nothing, like a piece of meat, then that's not good.\n\"They have to realise what goes into planning. They have to plan, and we have to plan.\"\nThe main reasons for cancellations were a lack of beds or ward space and staff shortages.\nFor operations cancelled on the day, emergencies take priority - something that can have a knock-on effect for operations scheduled for the following day as well.\nTwenty-nine trusts also provided data for cancellations made by patients themselves, which in many cases were higher than the number cancelled by the hospitals.\nAn NHS England spokeswoman said: \"The proportion of patients seeing their operations cancelled at the last minute remains under 1% in spite of record numbers of operations being scheduled.\n\"Our national data collection rightly requires trusts to focus on monitoring the number of last-minute cancellations, as this is where the most distress is caused for patients.\n\"Hospitals should continue to ensure that every effort is made to reschedule cancelled operations as soon as possible.\"\nScotland measures cancellations within 48 hours of the planned procedure. Figures published monthly show between 1-2% are cancelled for non-clinical reasons.\nIn Northern Ireland, around 1,000 operations were cancelled in 2015 for non-clinical reasons on the day, or the day before.\nIn Wales, around 1% of operations are cancelled for non-clinical reasons.\nThe Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn only saw five operations cancelled in 2015 one to three days before admission\nChief executive Dorothy Hosein said its success was down to \"a lot of pre-planning\".\nThe hospital, which cancelled 309 operations on the day in 2015, has three bed-planning meetings every day and is \"constantly juggling bed space and day surgery\".\nMrs Hosein said: \"It is critical to patients, so planning ahead is essential.\n\"We have put a focus on not cancelling operations.\n\"The planning a patient does to get to this hospital is quite significant, mentally as well as around their lifestyle.\"\nSaffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, said: \"There are many reasons why operations are cancelled at short notice.\n\"Some of these may be due to poor scheduling and a lack of effective planning, but this is very often not the case.\n\"Increasingly, we are hearing from NHS trusts that it is often down to a more general lack of availability of critical care beds and a lack of anaesthetists and surgeons.\n\"It is also often down to ever increasing emergency cases requiring theatre time that exceeds level of demand that has been expected.\"\nNora Cooke O'Dowd, a research analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said: \"If a person's operation has to be cancelled, it would be better if they are given as much notice as possible.\n\"It's stressful to have it cancelled on the day - the more notice, the better.\"\nBut patient groups say cancelled operations could have a serious impact on people's health.\nKatherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients' Association, said: \"You can't underestimate the upset for them, their family, their friends and everybody else if an operation is cancelled.\"\nMrs Murphy said the association heard about the impact of cancelled operations \"every day\".\n\"We are talking about individuals who are often in pain or suffering,\" she said.\n\"They will have made lots of arrangements.\n\"It can have a huge psychological or financial impact on people.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Not that long ago, lenders made it easy for people in their early 20s to climb onto the nearest ladder by offering interest-only mortgages.\nAs house prices rose year after year, homes looked like a solid investment. There appeared to be little danger of buyers slipping down to where they started.\nThen the financial crisis hit, the board became a seething mass of snakes, and the property market did not seem as easy to play after all.\nSo, how has the game changed now, and what is facing those who fell back to having to start all over again?\nWith an interest-only mortgage, householders pay off the interest on the loan but not the capital. At the end of the mortgage term, borrowers are expected to repay the capital.\nThe attraction of interest-only mortgages was obvious to many young first-time buyers. Many were aged in their early 20s, had just started their first job, and were happy to put off any real consideration of how they would pay the loan back, or to rely solely on the rising value of their home.\nIn addition, they were cheaper than the repayment option.\nBut, as they became more and more popular, this type of mortgage was placed more frequently under the microscope of the City regulator - the Financial Services Authority (FSA).\nIn 2006, when 24% of all new mortgages were lent on an interest-only basis, the FSA said most people with interest-only mortgages did not have \"robust plans\" to repay them\n\"There is nothing wrong with interest-only mortgages,\" said Clive Briault, of the FSA, six years ago. \"However, consumers must be very clear about how they are going to repay the loans they take out.\"\nThat comment may sound familiar because just a few weeks ago, Martin Wheatley, the managing director of the FSA said almost exactly the same thing.\n\"There is a place for interest-only,\" he told a mortgage industry conference. \"Lenders must ensure these mortgages are taken out by consumers with a concrete repayment plan.\"\nThe fears may not have changed, but the market for interest-only mortgages certainly has.\nIn the last week or so, RBS, NatWest and the Coventry Building Society have pulled out of the market altogether. They followed a withdrawal in October by the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide.\n\"Whether this is the ultimate final nail in the coffin remains to be seen, but it does look increasingly like interest only is destined to survive only as a niche product or the preserve of the wealthy through the private banking fraternity,\" said Andrew Montlake, director at mortgage broker Coreco.\nThe only lender to ease its stance is Santander which, after cutting back sharply on interest-only, is now allowing a mix of interest-only and repayment under a new deal.\nThe FSA would be pleased to see interest-only disappearing for good as a mainstream product, but that is not a view shared by everyone.\nSource: Moody's Investors Service\nJonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: \"Interest-only is increasingly becoming a niche product, the preserve of wealthier borrowers. It is a shame as you don't necessarily have to be wealthy to have a viable repayment strategy for an interest-only loan.\"\nThat refers to people like Malcolm King. He took out an interest-only mortgage more than 25 years ago, says he has never missed a payment, and has always had a plan to pay off the capital - based on investments and the success of his business.\n\"I made a decision and take total responsibility for it,\" he says. \"Most people went into this with their eyes open.\"\nHe says that, as he is now aged 61, he had to \"grovel\" to his lender to be allowed to continue borrowing on the same terms, even though he had a successful business and a solid repayment plan.\nIt is likely that Mr King, who lives in Cobham in Surrey, will not be the only homeowner in his part of the world facing the need to grovel to a lender.\nA recent report by Moody's Investors Service suggests that more than half of all outstanding mortgages are interest only in the south of England, compared with a third in the north of England.\n\"Less creditworthy borrowers [are] at risk of being unable to refinance onto new rates,\" the report said.\nThis means they face being locked into a mortgage, and have no choice but pay higher rates when their current deal expires.\nUnder FSA regulations, which will come into force in April 2014, lenders will have to put this repayment plan under greater scrutiny with a full affordability assessment.\nTo help these mortgage prisoners, the FSA has suggested that a new or existing lender can waive the rules for borrowers, who demonstrate a good payment history and do not want to increase the loan, to be able to shift onto a new deal.\nIn contrast, first-time buyers will be given the third degree.\nThe effect of this, according to estate agents, is that most are seeking the financial help of family and friends, and ensure they have their mortgage agreed before they even start searching for a home.\nBeckenham in Kent is a prime spot for such buyers. Good schools and convenient links to London mean it is popular with young families and professionals.\nBut, according to Robert Dabrowski, of estate agent Langford Russell, the interest-only mortgage is a \"dead market\" to those first-time buyers they see.\nAs a result, he says that first-time buyers have got older recently, and he is seeing more people buying as couples rather than on their own.\nWarren Pinner, sales director at neighbouring Curran and Pinner, says that first-time buyers with their finance already organised can make life a lot easier for estate agents.\nHowever, he predicts a steady return among some mortgage providers of home loans with an interest-only element.

With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls.\nNone of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles.\n\"We were looking for four months,\" she recalls, \"with a casting director and two assistants. We basically went everywhere.\n\"We went to agencies, but there were very few black girls. And then we went in to theatre classes and high schools, but we met most of our cast randomly on the street.\n\"We had to invent a group, with its alchemy and energy. But we also needed girls with wit, who were able to improvise, because some of the scenes required it.\n\"All the girls are non-professionals, whereas all the boys had already been on screen. That says something about the representation of black women in cinema.\"\nToure, 21, was asked to audition as she sat outside a restaurant in Paris's 14th arrondissement. \"At first I thought the casting process was a little strange,\" she admits.\n\"But there aren't many black actresses in Paris, so they had to do it that way. You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies.\n\"When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters. So we boycott them, and watch American movies instead.\n\"During the casting there were around 300 girls, who all have dreams about being actresses. But I guess we don't really believe we can do it, because we don't see many others doing it.\"\nLike Richard Linklater's Oscar-winning Boyhood, Girlhood is a coming-of-age movie. The circumstances, though, are vastly different.\nSciamma grew up in the Paris suburbs herself and says she was writing \"from the things I know - that there are people who have such energy, but they are not given a vision of who they should be.\"\nTold by her teacher to stop studying and get a job, Marieme plays truant with her new group of friends and becomes a gang fighter. Soon, footage of her beating up other girls is filmed and put on to social media.\n\"It's very true to life,\" says Toure. \"If you know the suburbs, you know you have the same gangs, the same fights - every French teenager can relate to it.\n\"Even when I read the script, there were similarities to my life. I've been followed in stores by shop security guards who are told to do it just because I am black.\n\"My own teacher told me not to bother continuing to study, but to go and get a job.\"\n\"I wanted to make a contemporary film,\" explains Sciamma, \"and this is an important part of contemporary culture in France.\n\"The situation is defined by our history with France's former colonies, France's urban policies, even France's architectural choices with the housing estates that make up the banlieues.\n\"It's a very French setting with an universal plot, which is why I think it's being seen by an international audience.\"\nGirlhood earned Sciamma a Cesar nomination for best director, while Toure was nominated as most promising actress.\n\"I was only the second black actress to be nominated for a Cesar in France,\" she points out. \"I think this has to have an impact on the film industry.\"\n\"Girlhood is statistically and symbolically a step,\" Sciamma goes on. \"It can change something because it did well at the box office. It shows that there is an audience and an interest for black characters.\n\"The film allowed the faces of four young black women to be everywhere in the street of Paris, on billboards, in the subway. I hope it means more stories are on the way.\"\nToure has gone back to study but hopes to continue acting. \"Lupita Nyong'o is my inspiration,\" she says. \"I think perhaps her breakthrough in 12 Years a Slave was the British having their own Girlhood moment.\n\"I love her performances, but most of all she's a very dark black woman and she's proud of her colour.

There is a complete lack of transparency.\n\"Bringing in a new man, or woman, is not going to change the problem. There needs to be a root-and-branch re-organisation.\"\nFifa's centre of power is its executive committee  (ExCo), and the fact that this small body of 24 people (one President, eight Vice-Presidents and 15 members) has such power over global football is a concern for many.\nMembers are appointed for a four year term, from among the six continental Confederations (eg Uefa in Europe) and 209 national football associations around the world.\nThe ExCo meets at least twice a year and among its major powers is determining the dates, locations and format of tournaments, including of course the World Cup.\nIt is this particular function which has aroused so much controversy - over the awards of the 2010 (South Africa), 2018 (Russia), and 2022 (Qatar) World Cups.\nMr Parry says - using good corporate practice as a guide - there are three main changes that the IoD would like to see Fifa make:\n\"This is a massive juncture for Fifa,\" says Mr Parry. \"If they get things right now, they have the chance to make a really positive change to world football for decades to come.\n\"If they have the appetite and desire, then they have the opportunity to become a beacon for other sports around the world.\"\nMaking sure the executive is held to account over its decisions will be key.\nSimon Chadwick, who is professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University Business School, says a reformed Fifa must have clear and published governance rules in place.\nHe agrees there must be a division of powers within Fifa, with a separate board and executive, and says it is crucial that \"those making the executive decisions should be separate from the people responsible for holding the financial purse strings\".\nIn addition Prof Chadwick believes that the membership of any new executive body should be widened \"to include not just members of football associations, but also fan representatives, sponsor representatives and other stakeholders\".\nSponsors, who invest millions in supporting Fifa events, have a particular interest in seeing that the sport they are backing is run cleanly, as association with a murkily-run organisation can easily tarnish a corporate reputation.\nFifa's previous attempts at governance reform\nIn 2011 an independent governance committee (IGC) was set up by Sepp Blatter, overseen by Mark Pieth, a professor of criminal law at Basel University.\nProf Pieth's team issued a final report in April 2014.\nHe said then that progress had been made on key areas, but called for further changes.\n\"The problem is not, or was not, Blatter alone. It's the structure - it's systemic in this institution,\" he said on Wednesday, the day after Mr Blatter announced his resignation.\nProf Pieth proposes a public body, or Fifa's host state Switzerland, should take responsibility for the organisation.\nAs well as corporate change there are also calls for Fifa to show it can be run on a more ethical basis.\nAndre Spicer, professor at Cass Business School in London, said the news that Sepp Blatter was standing down was just the beginning of the task ahead.\n\"When morally tarnished leaders head for the exit, people think the job is done,\" he said.\nHow Fifa makes and spends its money\n\"The departure of a high-profile leader who has overseen ethical failures is often celebrated - people think a change at the top is the most important indication an organisation is changing. In reality, it is only the very first step in what is likely to be an ultra-marathon of ethical improvement.\n\"Old leaders are often treated as a scapegoats; by getting rid of them, there is an irrational hope the organisation can erase all past sins. Sadly, the world is not like that. It is relatively easy to change the tone from the top, but cleaning up the mess in the middle is the hard part.\n\"As Fifa seeks to reform itself, it will find a change at the top is only 10% of the solution.

The heat in the stadium had been so severe that thousands of fans were unable to take their designated seats because they were in direct sunlight. But as the shadows grew longer, they crept forward from their shaded positions at the back of stands to get a closer view of the unfolding drama.\nThe second cooling break came with 15 minutes remaining, and by then one team clearly needed it more than the other.\nThe Netherlands squad crowded around their manager, like basketball players in a time-out.

But did it really exist?\nBBC News found out in November 2012\nThere was still time. Still time for Robben to sprint down the right flank once more. The Bayern Munich winger cut inside, skipped beyond Diego Reyes and went over Rafael Marquez's leg. Penalty. Joy and despair in one moment.\nHuntelaar did the rest from 12 yards, dispatching the penalty to set up a quarter-final against Costa Rica. \"Robben had been fouled, so Klaas Jan was asked, he didn't need any more encouragement. He was very cool,\" Van Gaal said.\nHe was not the only one. Van Gaal watched on as Robben leapt in the air, clenching his fists at the final whistle and the Dutch fell to the ground with pure relief. This was Van Gaal winning a match in Fergie time - an appropriate prelude to taking over the Manchester United job.\n\"The players showed they had the faith and the belief to go right to the very end,\" added Van Gaal, hinting at their willingness to buy into his tactical tweaks. \"You can't pull through like that if you don't have the unity that this group of players had. It gives us enormous confidence to go on.\"\nThe contrast with the Mexico players was stark. Those in green collapsed, overwhelmed by the manner of the turnaround, the heat, the emotion of a day when a place in the last eight for the first time since 1986 had been within their grasp.\nMexico may have stumbled their way to this World Cup but they leave with their reputation and that of their manager, the tremendous Miguel Herrera, enhanced.\nOchoa trudged into the news conference to collect his man of the match award and forced a smile, but it was clear he was crestfallen. This was not a footballer who deserved to be on the losing side.\nMexico may have been more used to the heat but Herrera still felt it had affected his team.\n\"What goes against football is playing in this weather,\" he said. \"We didn't see a worthy show because even such a good team as Netherlands, the temperature sapped their pace. You can't give at the same level in the 90 minutes in that heat. You are suffocated by the sun, the humidity, by being worn out.\"\nThe heat aside, this was another tremendous match in a World Cup that remains as unpredictable as any.\nVan Gaal ensured his side march on. \"He knows what it is going to happen,\" Vlaar said. \"If it doesn't happen that way, he changes it and that gives the players confidence.

In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.\nThe US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban.\nProfile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl\nThe circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency.\nSeveral commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished.\nThe New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time.\nUS officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military.\nThe US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. \"When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.\"\nThe defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry.\nTaliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.\nThe exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter.\nOnce the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters \"SF?\" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: \"Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time.\"\nTaliban release video of handover\nSgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the \"Standing with Bowe\" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho.\nNegotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began three years ago with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar.\nBut the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.\nDirect negotiations broke down a year ago when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar.\nThe issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap.\nOn Thursday, Mr Obama said Sgt Bergdahl's health was deteriorating and officials were \"deeply concerned about it\".\nBut the prisoner swap was apparently sped up after US officials determined the Taliban would likely kill Sgt Bergdahl if any word of the deal was leaked, according to congressional and White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press.\nDefence Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC's Katty Kay he and other military chiefs based their decision \"on the information that we had, that his life, his health, were in peril\".\nHis father Robert Bergdahl said Bowe was struggling to speak English after his long captivity. In an emotional White House lawn press conference with Barack Obama shortly after the release, Robert Bergdahl delivered his son a message in Pashto, the language of his captors.\nAfter immediate medical attention at a military hospital in Germany,  Sgt Bergdahl was flown to San Antonio, Texas, to continue treatment.\nOn Friday, Army officials said he was in a \"stable condition\".\nHe \"looked good\", was in uniform, and saluted, Maj Gen Joseph DiSalvo said.\n\"He appeared just like any sergeant would when they see a two-star general - a little bit nervous,\" Gen DiSalvo said. \"But he looked good, saluted, and had good deportment.\"\nCan you lose your language?\nThe exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari.\nThey are thought to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001.\nFazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims.\nKhairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden.\nUS President Barack Obama says Qatar has given assurances \"that it will put in place measures to protect our national security\".\nUnder the deal, the five freed Taliban detainees will be banned from leaving Qatar for at least a year, meaning they cannot return to Afghanistan until after a majority of US forces have left.\nThe Associated Press' Kathy Gannon, who was shot in Afghanistan while covering the recent elections, says the five men are important but not likely to change the balance of the war - and having been away from Afghanistan for more than a decade, they would not find Taliban foot soldiers very loyal.\nSome argue there is US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran.\nBut Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called it a fundamental shift in policy that would act as an incentive for further abductions of US personnel.\nSome US lawmakers have complained the swap breaches a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House says it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in \"unique and exigent circumstances\".\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, normally a White House ally, was enraged that the president had not notified her or the intelligence committee she leads, of the pending swap, although a White House official did call her on Monday to apologise for the delay.\nThe US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives.\nRepublican Senator John McCain told the BBC the swaps \"threatened\" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers have called for a inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process.\nBut Mr Obama is publically unapologetic for the swap.\n\"We saw an opportunity and we seized it,\" he said, adding \"as commander-in-chief I am responsible for those kids\".\nNo Obama apology for Bergdahl deal\nCorrespondents say it is unclear what impact the release will have on a wider peace process.\nThe Afghan High Peace Council want talks with the Taliban to happen inside Afghanistan, and does not want to involve the Americans.\nBowe Bergdahl returned to the US on 13 June 2014, arriving at a medical centre in Texas where he finished the last phase of his reintegration process.\nIn his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, a rally scheduled months ahead was quickly turned into a homecoming event that was cancelled.\nCity officials cited safety concerns, because of a large increase in the number of expected attendees, and local officials have received messages blasting the town for honouring Sgt Bergdahl's return.\nSgt Bergdahl returned to active duty in July, working at a desk job at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.\nIn March 2015, he was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehaviour before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command unit or place.\nA preliminary hearing will be heard in front of a judge at Fort Sam Houston. A date has not been set for that hearing.\nHe faces up to five years in prison on the desertion charge and life in prison on the misbehaviour charge.\nHow to 'reintegrate' a returning POW", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I started drawing for print then.\"\nFrom there, he went on to illustrate nearly 300 books with writers such as Joan Aiken, Michael Rosen and John Yeoman.\nBlake also worked on more than 150 episodes of the BBC children's show Jackanory, providing the illustrations for the books narrated for the young audience.\n\"I draw every day - unless I'm being interviewed,\" Blake told the BBC.\n\"What is nice is to have different kinds of things to do.\"\nBlake began working with Dahl after a meeting in 1975 set up by their publisher.\nBy that point, Dahl had already published some of his most famous works including James and The Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Fantastic Mr Fox.\n\"Initially I was rather apprehensive because he was a big chap and very famous, but it was a relationship that worked,\" said Blake.\n\"Because I had established myself as an illustrator, I had something to bring to it.\"\nBlake became the first ever Children's Laureate when the position was created in 1999, using his tenure to promote literature for the young.\nAmong his other accolades are the JM Barrie lifetime achievement award, which he received in 2008, the Hans Christian Andersen Award for illustration in 2002 and an honorary degree from the Anglia Ruskin university in Cambridge.\nHe was made an OBE in 1988, a CBE in 2004 and will receive his knighthood at Buckingham Palace during 2013, for his services to illustration.\nThe 80-year-old's most recent collaboration has been with comic actor and writer David Walliams.\nThey first worked together on Walliams' debut children's novel The Boy in the Dress, which was published in 2008.\nHe admitted he was initially apprehensive about working with the Little Britain co-creator.\n\"I was also worried it would have loads of projectile vomiting,\" he said, \"but I wanted to do it as soon as I read it.\"\nHe added: \"I had breakfast with David and I think we were on the same wavelength. It was very nice because he wanted me to do it and I got so involved in it that I did twice as many drawings as I was supposed to.\"\nThe pair have now worked on five books together, including Walliams' latest book Mr Stink, about a girl who befriends a local tramp and hides him in her garden shed to stop him being driven out of town.\nWalliams said of Blake: \"His work kind of means children's books somehow, so even if you haven't studied it or don't pay attention to who illustrators are, you know his work.\n\"It has been copied everywhere so many times that it is now part of the culture.\"\nHe added: \"I think the magic of his work is that it doesn't tell you exactly what the person looks like, it allows you add your own imagination to it.\"\nAs well as illustrating books, Blake also does work with hospitals and mental health units, decorating buildings with his sketches.\n\"It's a different kind of brief, a different kind of audience. A lot of the pictures I do in hospitals are to cheer up gaunt surroundings,\" he said.\nHe was also the instigator of the House of Illustration project, which aims to open a museum dedicated to illustration in London by 2014.\nHowever, even the most beloved of artists have their critics and one slight levelled at Blake is the consistently upbeat nature of his drawings.\n\"There are a lot of smiles about, it's true,\" he admitted. \"People have come up and said 'thank you for your work' - and 'joy' is the word they've used, but I've also been reproached for it, for being too cheerful.\n\"But if you add a smile, it doesn't make it necessarily joyful.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

We already know season tickets, along with some other fares, will go up by inflation plus 3% in January 2013 and January 2014.\nThey'll then go up by inflation plus 1% in 2015. The government says it wants to stop further rises by saving money across the industry. If it can't manage that, fares could rise for many years to come to help pay for all this new investment.\nShe refused to rule out renationalising the railways to ensure better value for money.\nBut Labour played down the significance of her comments, saying the focus would be on local solutions.\nBob Crow, general secretary of transport union the RMT, said: \"What we need is investment in rail today not yet another political promise of jam tomorrow.\"\nChief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, Anthony Smith, said passengers would welcome the \"scale and ambition\" of the investment.\nBut he added: \"Value for money remains a concern.

There were thousands of people there, it was sold out for the foil, and TV cameras too. I was so nervous.\n\"In the individuals in the opening round I lost to (Germany's) Peter Joppich, my favourite fencer of all time. And when I look back at the match I realise that's why I lost.\n\"I had fenced him two months before in a Grand Prix and won 15-12. He won at the Olympics because he had already been there before.\n\"He knew how to deal with it. You only learn that from being there.\n\"The world number ones are there for a reason. They can deal with that pressure.\n\"I would love to go to Rio with all that experience under my belt because I will know how to deal with it. But we have to qualify first.\"\nSo as he prepares for this week's World Championships and hopefully another successful step on the route to Rio, what is he enjoying most about life Stateside?\n\"The help and support of everyone I am training with,\" Davis says.\n\"They have no reason to help but everyone does.

They all get paid for each piece of work they do, from which Flitto takes a small percentage.\nIn the first feature of new six-part series called \"The Making of Me\", we look back at key stages in Mr Lee's life and the development of his business.\nDue to his father's job with a global company, Mr Lee spent most of his childhood living overseas.\nHe was born in Kuwait, where he spent his first four years, before the family then moved to UK.\nAfter three years in the UK, the family relocated again, this time to the US, before moving to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia 24 months later.\nEducated in international schools, he was quick to pick up English, French and Arabic, the first three languages Mr Lee added to his native Korean.\n\"I met all these different people from different countries,\" he says.\n\"What I realised is that all human beings are the same you know, but because of the different languages we misunderstand each other.\"\nAfter seven years in Saudi Arabia, Mr Lee's family moved back to South Korea where he finished high school, and then went to the country's prestigious Korean University.\nIt was at college that friends of his started to ask him to help them translate their homework into English, which was required as part of their courses.\n\"So friends would say to me, 'Simon, if you translate this homework into English I'm going to buy you dinner',\" he says.\n\"And more and more friends were asking me to do that, so I didn't have enough time.\"\nRealising the business potential of translation services, Mr Lee started getting other multilingual friends to help out, and his idea for setting up a company was born.\nFlitto was launched in September 2012, but rather than start the business in South Korea, Mr Lee decided to relocate to London.\nHe said he chose to do this for two main reasons - he wanted to temporarily get away from his friends who had well paid jobs in corporate South Korea, and because London is such a multi-cultural city.\nHe says: \"I was starting a business, so I had no money. So what I thought is that [if I stayed in Seoul] I would compare myself with my friends, and that would make me really sad.\n\"So I just wanted to go some place quiet. And London is the centre of Europe, with lots and lots of different people who speak different languages.\"\nTo help get the business up and running, Mr Lee based himself at a shared working space in London run by a start-up support organisation called Techstars. This gave him both mentoring support and funding.\nYet with little funds to advertise, Mr Lee had to come up with a novel way of drawing attention to Flitto's website and app, and attracting both translators and customers.\nHis answer was for Flitto to collate the Twitter and other social media feeds of Western pop stars such as Lady Gaga, and encourage people to translate them into different languages, in exchange for merchandise of the celebrity in question.\nIt worked, and Flitto soon started to see its business and brand recognition grow, with more and more customers, and a growing number of translators signing up.\nToday Flitto, which has its headquarters in Seoul, and has just 34 full-time staff, says it gets 70,000 translation requests per day.\nThese range from individuals wanting a few lines translated, to businesses requesting bulk work. Each translator - all one million of them - is graded out of five in terms of feedback on the quality of their work.\nAs an additional revenue stream Flitto's website also has a store section, where people can buy everything from clothing to iPhone cases. And to further drive traffic to the site, it also has an editorial section, which includes stories and photo galleries from around the world.\nMr Lee says the fact that Flitto doesn't directly employ translators means that it can significantly undercut the traditional translation service providers. Its costs start from 10 cents (6p) for 250 characters.\nAnd he says that he does not feel threatened by the growth of online computerized translation services because he does not believe they will ever be as accurate as human beings doing the work.\nMr Lee says his biggest error was an earlier attempt to set up a similar translation business.\nThis was back in 2007, when he launched a company called Flyingcane.\nHe said it was the right idea, just at the wrong time.\n\"The problem was that there were no smart phones back in 2007,\" he says.\nHe said that as a result of this, there was obviously no mobile phone app side to the business, and this meant that the translation work was slower because people couldn't do it as easily when they were on the move.\nAfter Flyingcane failed, Mr Lee then spent a number of years working for a South Korean mobile phone network, before returning to his business idea in 2011, and then launching Flitto in 2012.\nIn terms of the day-to-day running of the company, Mr Lee says he can be a workaholic, and didn't take a holiday for six years.\nIn the end, matters came to a head with fellow board members.\nHe says: \"My investors forced me to take a vacation, which I never wanted. They told me 'Simon, you don't look good, you don't look healthy, so we think you need to time to go off for fresh air, and to relax yourself'.\"\nMr Lee says that people thinking of setting up their own businesses need to be aware that it can take it out of you.\n\"Whenever my juniors ask me 'Simon do you recommend that I should start my own business?', I say 'no, there is too much stress'.\"\nBut despite the inevitable anxiety that running your own company brings, Mr Lee says he recommends that people try it.\n\"Just stick to your dream and believe in yourself, that's my advice.\n\"Everyday you feel your heartbeat, that you are actually living your life.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] The previously unknown case will place fresh pressure on the force, which last year was forced to apologise to seven women who had similar relationships.\nThe woman in the latest case told BBC Newsnight she was a victim of \"psychological torture\".\nThe Met would neither confirm nor deny the identity of the undercover officer.\nThe woman, who is being referred to by the pseudonym Andrea to protect her identity, was friends with a group of left-wing political activists, mostly in the Socialist Party, who are thought to have been the target for long-term infiltration by the Met.\nThe Socialist Party is a democratic political group to the left of the Labour Party that rejects violence.\nOn Monday, she started legal action against the Metropolitan Police over the relationship, which lasted from 2002 to 2004.\nA joint investigation by BBC Newsnight and The Guardian has unmasked Andrea's former partner, who was pretending to be a left-wing political activist.\nHe used the cover name Carlo Neri. The BBC knows his real name but is not publishing it to protect his family.\nMr Neri proposed to Andrea in 2003 and she accepted. He was welcomed into her family and her parents, who lived in Scotland, viewed him as a future son-in-law.\nAndrea told Newsnight that the deception she suffered meant she was the victim of \"psychological torture\" authorised by the police.\nWhen he was living with Andrea undercover in central London, from November 2002 to May 2004, Mr Neri was married with a child.\nHe had a double life and needed to invent reasons to be away from the flat he and his wife shared in Maida Vale.\nHe showed Andrea photographs of a boy and said it was his son from a previous relationship. He said that his former partner had moved to Cornwall with the boy and he wanted to re-establish contact.\nFull story on Newsnight on Monday 18 January at 22:30 on BBC Two\n\"He was probably away from home for four or five nights every fortnight and that would be due to work trips and every other weekend he would go to Cornwall to see his child,\" Andrea said.\n\"As far as I was concerned, I was going to spend my life with this man and his life was my life. Having that strong relationship with a child is a really important thing.\"\nIn fact there were no access trips to Cornwall. The photographs were of his real son who lived with his wife less than 10 miles away. It was just part of his cover story.\nWhen he was living with Andrea in Maida Vale, Mr Neri liked to make himself useful to her friends in the Socialist Party. He said he was a locksmith.\n\"He quite often said people could improve their security of where they lived and again that seemed at the time to be hugely helpful.

Carlo Neri was supposed to spend Christmas and New Year with Andrea at home in Maida Vale. But at the last minute, he told her his father was gravely ill in Italy and he had to be by his side.\nWhen he returned from his trip to Italy - she now thinks that was another lie - he had completely changed.\nHe told her that he had just found out that his dying father had sexually abused a female relative. In retrospect, she believes this was all part of his cover story plan to end the relationship.\n\"The stuff that he was disclosing was horrendous. It was quite awful√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ when you love them and you see them being in that much pain - or so you think - you want to support them.\"\nAndrea says it was the extreme nature of these lies that was particularly damaging.\nHer solicitor, Harriet Wistrich from the law firm Birnberg Peirce, will argue that it was cruel and completely disproportionate to be targeting political activists close to the Socialist Party.\nAndrea's experience is very similar to the stories of eight women who were also duped into entering sexual relationships with undercover police.\nAs part of the Met's settlement of all but one of their legal claims in November, Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt issued a stark apology, saying that some undercover officers had entered into \"long-term intimate sexual relationships with women which were abusive, deceitful, manipulative and wrong\".\n\"I acknowledge that these relationships were a violation of the women's human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma,\" he added.\nA public inquiry into undercover policing was opened last summer. It's expected to run for several years and the Metropolitan Police told the BBC it would cooperate fully.\nMs Wistrich is now pressing for the disclosure of the cover names of all the undercover police officers authorized to infiltrate political and protest groups.\nShe told Newsnight: \"This is clearly a pattern that they worked on. The other women that had other relationships described similar exit strategies and in each of those cases they were very harmful.\n\"This is one of the worst I've heard in terms of inventing a whole story of sexual abuse and violence that didn't actually exist and I think that was a particularly sick thing to do.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police refused to confirm or deny whether Mr Neri was an undercover officer. That's the standard response.\nBut in a statement, Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt told Newsnight that the Met \"no longer carries out 'long-term infiltration deployments' in these kinds of groups but would accept responsibility for past failings\".\nHe accepted there was a risk of \"collateral intrusion\" in some of these cases.\nMr Hewitt admitted there were \"failures of supervision and management\" in the past, but stressed that undercover policing is now \"extensively supervised\".\nHe said: \"All deployments are now rigorously assessed for necessity and proportionality and governed by a strict legal framework that is subject to independent oversight.\"\nRichard Watson's film on undercover policing is on BBC Newsnight on Monday 18 January at 22:30 on BBC Two - you can also catch up afterwards on iPlayer.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "[TASK=xsum] Is the new popularity of anti-EU parties in the UK, France, Greece and Spain a hangover from the crash of 2007-8, the euro crisis of 2010-13 and long years of squeezed living standards - a protest from those who feel dispossessed in an economic sense?\nOr does the surge of UKIP, the Front National and Syriza, inter alia, reflect a more profound sense that the mainstream parties and conventional political institutions no longer serve the interests of millions of people?\nIs it \"the economy, stupid\", or is it \"globalisation and a dysfunctional EU, stupid\"?\nThe answer matters.\nMaybe the economy is easier to fix - although not necessarily in the eurozone, which still lacks the requisite cross-border political solidarity that would allow the excessive debt burden to be pooled, and its growth-deadening impact to be mitigated.\nAs for the UK, it is possible that the current economic recovery will suddenly translate into a significant rise in living standards, that has been so elusive for six years. But the prime minister might not be best advised to count on it.\nA significant microcosm of both the problem and the solution is London - where, significantly, UKIP resonated less and performed less well than elsewhere.\nPart of the explanation is that globalisation - which gives many a sense that they have little direct control over their economic destiny - enriches London.\nMuch of the rest of the UK sees globalisation and its manifestations - such as immigration - as disempowering, impoverishing and a threat. Whereas for Londoners, globalisation is an economic competition they are apparently winning.\nOf course, there are tensions within London generated by the nature of its success - the west London ghettoes of the non-dom super-rich aren't everyone's cup of tea, and high and inflationary property prices undermine social cohesion.\nBut I haven't heard many Londoners describe the capital as \"the dark star of the economy\", which is how it was characterised in March by the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond.\nThe capital's gravitational pull for what Mr Salmond called \"resources, people and energy\" is bound to be seen with different degrees of enthusiasm by those inside and outside the Great Wen.\nAlex Salmond's hope was that an independent Scotland would be able to exert a new pull for talent and money, and provide more economic balance in this island.\nWhich some would say is a challenging argument to make, since the trends that are pumping up London are supra-national. In a world where barriers to the flow of money, services, people, goods and data have progressively been removed, vast flows of money, services, people, goods and data are drawn to where they find their ilk.\nOr to put it another way, the rise of London is the rise of one of the world's megacities, those urban centres which thrive semi-independently of the countries where they are located.\nAccording to the consultancy McKinsey, some 70% of all worldwide economic activity takes place in the world's 600 largest cities. And the most vital cities, on its analysis, are those that are most connected by becoming hubs or waypoints for skilled people, for goods, for services, for capital, and for data.\nOn this view, London is one of only six truly connected cities, along with New York, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. London scores relatively poorly only for goods traffic.\nWhat is striking about this half-dozen of the global elite metropolises is that three of them, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore, are city-states.\nSo it is not surprising that London is seen by some, including seemingly Mayor Johnson periodically, as extra the UK, almost a city-state.\nInevitably therefore one of the big political and economic questions of our age is whether national governments should encourage or attempt to stifle the rise and rise of these great cities - because they can be seen not only as economically over-mighty but politically too.\nThe British government sees London as a great asset to be nurtured - punching above its weight in respect of tax generation and helping to sell the UK to the rest of the world.\nSo it will probably see the latest forecast by the CEBR of London's growth as a reason to be cheerful. The CEBR sees London as accounting for almost a third of all UK growth in the next five years.\nThe CEBR expects the London economy to expand by 15.4% till 2019, faster than other UK regions, and compared with 10.7% for the UK as a whole.\nWhich means that London's share of the total British economy will continue to grow. According to official figures, the output or gross value added of London was 21% of UK output in 2007. It had risen to 22% in 2011, and if the CEBR is right, London will be nudging a quarter of the entire UK economy by 2019.\nLooked at in that way, it is pretty difficult to see how London could be put back in its box, even if the government wished to do this, without doing serious harm to the nation's finances and prosperity.\nIf London's growth were to slow considerably, then revenue generation for the government and employment creation for the country would also slow - probably harmfully.\nSo for those who want a more regionally balanced UK economy, the trick presumably is to spur faster growth outside London.\nBut that has been the ambition of so many governments, for so long. And has arguably become even harder in a world where capital seems increasingly drawn to capitals (very bad pun, sorry).\nOr to put it another way, the problem isn't London. The problem (if there is one) is that globalisation is all about how money, data and skilled people do what they want and go where they want.\nWhich implies the task of government is to harness and tame capital's love of metropolises in such a way that London and its peers are seen as engines of national wealth creation, and providers of national resources that otherwise would not be affordable.\nThat said, if globalisation means that the rise of London and other outward looking megacities is unstoppable, it is difficult to see how the economic gap between capital and provinces can do anything but continue to widen.\nAnd whether redistribution of wealth from urban centre to the rest of the country will allay the legitimate fears of many outside the megacities that the global economy is not run for them, well that is moot.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

That's how a missed test can happen.\"\nSotherton's sentiments were echoed by Jenny Meadows.\n\"It is very difficult to work out where you are going to be three months in advance,\" said the former European indoor 800m champion.\n\"You do have to remember, of course, where you said you would be and make sure you are at that place. Even this week I was out of the house before my testing slot should have started.\"\nWhile European and Commonwealth 800m silver medallist Lynsey Sharp spent one hour every day for two weeks sat in a Boston cafe while on holiday because the doorbell did not work in her rented apartment.\n\"There is not a lot of room for mistakes,\" said Sharp. \"I do think we have great system but it can make it difficult for athletes.\"\nMichael Rimmer, who won an 800m silver medal at the 2010 European Championships, said he had missed tests in the past and has suggested athletes are tagged so the testers know where they are at all times.\nBut Michele Verroken, a sports ethics and anti-doping adviser, said there had to be \"an element of surprise\" to testing.\n\"There is no obligation on the testing agency to test you in just that hour because athletes would manipulate the system and provide you with a clean sample,\" she said.\nChristine Ohuruogu, who won 400m gold at the 2012 Olympics, was given a one-year ban in 2006 for missing three out-of-competition tests.\nThe independent disciplinary committee which heard the Briton's case admitted it was a \"harsh sanction\" for someone who had \"no intention of infringing anti-doping rules\".\nThe ban was described as a \"much-needed wake-up call for athletes\" by John Scott, who was UK Sport director of drug-free sport.\nSapstead believes that UK athletes are \"incredibly supportive of the whereabouts system\" despite the requirements placed on them.\nShe claims athletes understand that it protects them and their sport.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

She had suffered an ectopic pregnancy three weeks earlier.\nGravesend Coroner's Court heard the former drug user was taking methadone to treat her addiction, but had stopped for a few days.\nMs Hollands was given an electrocardiogram (ECG) and methadone, and was given her discharge papers.\nHer former partner Carl Alleyne said she was in pain and not breathing properly, but was told the hospital \"needed the bed space\".\nHe refused to take her home and she died a few hours later from a blockage in the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs.\nDr Khan put her symptoms down to drug withdrawal, the inquest heard.\nHe claimed not to have seen the medical notes labelling her as \"at risk\" and detailing her chest pain, which would have made him consider a pulmonary embolism.\nBut the medical notes were found with Dr Khan's own writing on the back, proving he had seen, but not properly read, the vital information on the paper.\nMs Hollands' family's barrister, Edward Ramsay, asked the doctor: \"It means you could not have read what was staring you in the face?\"\n\"Yes,\" he replied.\n\"Simply turning over the page and Sian may well be alive - do you accept that?\" Mr Ramsey added. Dr Khan agreed.\nMr Ramsay said Ms Hollands was \"labelled a heroin addict and nobody considered any other diagnosis\".\nHer mother, Nicole Smith, said that more than 500 days since her daughter's death, they were finally getting the truth.\n\"She was recovering, trying to put her life right, and they condemned her and stopped her from ever moving forward.\"\nA spokesman for Darent Valley Hospital said: \"We extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Sian Hollands.

The jury heard he was placed near the goal line at 15:26 BST - 20 minutes after the match was halted.\nPC Neil Mutch was giving Mr Hughes chest compressions while his colleague PC Barbara Hardwick - now Barbara Woodward - gave him the kiss of life.\nMr Hughes was unresponsive, the jury heard.\nMr Mullin said: \"I was rubbing Eric's hand.

Come on!'\"\nMr Mullin said the officers, who were both crying, eventually stopped.\nHe said: \"The chap just looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said: 'I'm sorry I can't do any more.' They were so upset.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Mutch said that after seeing Mr Hughes he was \"in a very bad state\", while Mrs Woodward was \"very upset\".\nMrs Woodward told the court she had \"blocked out\" a lot of what happened on the day of the disaster.\nThe court heard how the officers stopped giving first aid after a man who said he was a doctor told them Mr Hughes had died.\nPaul Clark was an apprentice electrician from Derbyshire. His parents described him as a \"lovely young man\" who was \"fun-loving and caring\".\nHe went to the match with his father, Kenneth, and a friend, Andrew Booth.\nMr Booth, who was with his friend inside pen three, said Mr Clark moved towards the front of the enclosure shortly before kick-off.\n\"I would have said he was pushed forward by the crowd,\" Mr Booth said.\nHe did not see his friend alive again and said that after kick-off the pressure in the enclosure intensified.\nMatthew Hill, a barrister representing the coroner, said there was no video or eyewitness evidence showing how Mr Clark made it off the terraces.\nAfter the disaster Mr Clark's father, who had a seated ticket for the match, waited for his son at a meeting point. When he did not turn up, he went to a nearby police station for help.\nMr Clark eventually called his wife, Susan, who travelled to Sheffield that evening.\nThey later identified their son's body in the stadium's gymnasium.\nThe inquests, in Warrington, Cheshire, are due to resume on Thursday.\nBBC News: Profiles of all those who died", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
