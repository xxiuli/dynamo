{"text": "Question: When do treaties apply? Context: The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, the \"core\" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the √Öland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law.

Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site. This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the \"Brompton Boilers\", which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858-9 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts, were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery.

{"text": "Question: What would be needed to host a larger population?

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj√≥, and inland dwellers.

{"text": "Question: What impact did the high school education movement have on the presence of skilled workers? Context: During the mass high school education movement from 1910‚Äì1940, there was an increase in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

{"text": "Question: How much larger would cicada predator populations be if cicada outbreaks occurred at 14 and 15 year intervals? Context: The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of \"Social Darwinism\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

{"text": "Question: Who did a morphologically analysis in 1985 that concluded cydippids are not monophyletic? Context: Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small ‚Äì so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What present day county is New Rochelle in? Context: New Rochelle, located in the county of Westchester on the north shore of Long Island Sound, seemed to be the great location of the Huguenots in New York. It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called \"Bauffet's Point\" after traveling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting of six thousand one hundred acres with the help of Jacob Leisler. It was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church \"Eglise du St. Esperit\" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or \"Huguenot Burial Ground\", has since been recognized as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Ediacaran eoandromeda can be regarded to represent what? Context: Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerst√§tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species ‚Äì for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: A dollar spent by a poor person is likely to provide what for them? Context: Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number ‚Äì economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis. One of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well.

{"text": "Question: What is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov? Context: On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal ‚Äì and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

Context: Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small ‚Äì so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished.

Context: The Writers Guild of America strike that halted production of network programs for much of the 2007‚Äì08 season affected the network in 2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09, as various ABC shows that premiered in 2007, such as Dirty Sexy Money, Pushing Daisies, Eli Stone and Samantha Who?, did not live to see a third season; other series such as Boston Legal and the U.S. version of Life on Mars suffered from low viewership, despite the former, a spin off of The Practice, being a once-highlighted breakout series when it debuted in 2005. One of the network's strike-replacement programs during that time was the game show Duel, which premiered in December 2007. The program would become a minor success for the network during its initial six-episode run, which led ABC to renew Duel as a regular series starting in April 2008. However, Duel suffered from low viewership during its run as a regular series, and ABC canceled the program after sixteen episodes.

{"text": "Question: Who did Alexander I marry? Context: Normans came into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings, such as Robert the Bruce, as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans. King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the \"Davidian Revolution\". Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother M√°el Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2.

{"text": "Question: The speed of the killing response of the human immune system is a product of what process? Context: In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7‚Äì0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13‚Äì7 against the 4‚Äì11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27‚Äì20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.

The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the \"Apologie\" of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.

{"text": "Question: What does colonialism lack that imperialism has? Context: The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What British cultural trend during the Georgian is linked to design during the same period? Context: The galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture. For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, increasing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival.

{"text": "Question: If you do not know both magnitude and direction of two forces on an object, what would you call that situation? Context: Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

However, as the Reformation continued, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity. In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren L√ºgen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe. In it, he takes a hardline against Judaism, writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed.

{"text": "Question: What does the Beroe eat?  Context: Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations, but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find. In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of \"Social Darwinism\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyce√¶), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast DNAs have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: What kind of structure is a carboxysome? Context: The alga Cyanophora, a glaucophyte, is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast. The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest. Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts. Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids, which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in. The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes. For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Who was the duke in the battle of Hastings? Context: The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Which laws mentioned predate EU law? Context: The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s. It is an important general principle of international law and public law, which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, specially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law. In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that \"those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations\".", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size. Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.

{"text": "Question: MHC antigens on normal body cells are recognized by what receptor on NK cells? Context: Natural killer cells, or NK cells, are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes. Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as \"missing self.\" This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex) ‚Äì a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells. They were named \"natural killer\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are \"missing self.\" For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of \"missing self\". Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: Where do dikes form? Context: The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What do beroids typically eat? Context: Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead ends\" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter.

{"text": "Question: What  does ozone's characteristic to cause damage effect? Context: Trioxygen (O\n3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O\n2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O\n2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O\n4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O\n2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O\n8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O\n2 or O\n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal ‚Äì and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

{"text": "Question: What type of vote must the Parliament have to either block or suggest changes to the Commission's proposals? Context: To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council.

Context: BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels. This changed as from 1 July 2007, and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality.

High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.

{"text": "Question: What is the logic behind the cicadas prime number evolutionary strategy? Context: The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How is the Pauli exclusion priciple manifested in the macro world? Context: It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: How many total judges are there in the EU? Context: The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.

{"text": "Question: What bacteria lives inside a protective capsule that serves to prevent cell lysis? Context: An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}
{"text": "Question: Who is suited to interpret the Treaties? Context: The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, the \"core\" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the √Öland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law. Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives.

Context: A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members.

Context: For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria.

{"text": "Question: What is an example of illegal disobedience? Context: Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\" Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.

He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, considered Luther's service too papistic; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass. Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed.

{"text": "Question: What probiotic flora is found in unpasteurized yogurt? Context: Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron. This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness. However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an \"overgrowth\" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection). There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth.

The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.

{"text": "Question: What drives down wages in a job with many workers willing to work a lot? Context: A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members.

{"text": "Question: What is the receptor that killer T cells use to bind to specific antigens that are complexed with the MHC Class 1 receptor of another cell? Context: Killer T cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below).", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What type of algorithm is trial division? Context: Modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

Context: The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What was Norman Cantor's theory about the plague? Context: A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

{"text": "Question: What did Luther get implicated in concerning Philip I? Context: From December 1539, Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who wanted to marry one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting. Philip solicited the approval of Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs. The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling, and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined, he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter. As a result, on 4 March 1540, Philip married a second wife, Margarethe von der Saale, with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses. However, Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret, and he threatened to make Luther's advice public. Luther told him to \"tell a good, strong lie\" and deny the marriage completely, which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy. In the view of Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, \"giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made, and, next to the landgrave himself, who was directly responsible for it, history chiefly holds Luther accountable\". Brecht argues that Luther's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice, but that he miscalculated the political implications.

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.

His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing \"bad medicine\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.

In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110‚Äì120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished.

This \"Decision Time\" is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote. At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking \"Are we all agreed?\", to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces \"There will be a division\" and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote.

{"text": "Question: Where were Persians more successful compared to Chinese in the Yuan? Context: Politically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of \"barbarians\" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: \"... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only \"Mongols and Tartars\" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them\".", "task_id": 3, "task_name": "squad"}

But then, at the so-called Rheinbrech, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water.

{"text": "Question: How are the packets routed  Context: In connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information. The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.

Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.

{"text": "In the Dorfman Theatre there's The Red Lion - Marber's account of modern masculinity laid bare in an old-fashioned football club.  The much larger Olivier is home to what he calls a 'fiddled about with' version of George Farquhar's 1707 classic comedy The Beaux' Stratagem.\nAnd in the Lyttelton there's a new version of Turgenev's 1870s Russian classic usually known as A Month in the Country but now re-titled Three Days in the Country.\nNo writer has previously filled all three auditoriums on the same night.  Only the 225-seat Temporary Theatre has evaded Marber's clutches.  \"But it's just the way the scheduling worked out,\" he says.  \"No one really planned it this way\".  But it's proof that a long fallow period for the playwright has ended.\nIn the mid-1990s he was the hottest young writer in London theatre.  There were big hits at the National - and on Broadway - such as Dealer's Choice (1995) and Closer (1997).  Closer was made into a film by Mike Nichols starring Julia Roberts and Jude Law.\nBut until this year Marber, now 50, hadn't come up with an entirely new stage-play for a decade.  He says the reason was simple.\n\"I couldn't think of one.  I tried and I abandoned various plays.  I got half way there sometimes, or a quarter of the way there.  But a play is something you have to live with for a very long time.  You've got to love the thing and I just didn't manage it.\"\nThe Red Lion is a tragedy about football, which I suggest to him may be a wholly new genre.  \"Not if you're an Arsenal fan.  But I don't think the play wholly is a tragedy: it has laughs too.\"\nIt's not the first of Marber's works to address the nature of modern masculinity.  Many of his characters appear intimate with despair.  I ask him if there's a line from The Red Lion back to Turgenev  - a profoundly sad story which has gorgeously comic moments too.\n\"Yes I think it's true that there is a link.  There is an underlying tragedy in both plays.  But in Three Days, for instance, our brilliant cast gets real comedy out of the situations Turgenev created.\"\nCritics have praised the way performers such as Mark Gatiss, John Simm and Debra Gillett (who's married to Marber) extract both humour and sadness from his reworked version of the Russian original.\n\"All these three projects were very different.  I loved being back in Farquhar's comic world - it was a play I did as a student and I loved it then.  But with Three Days I'm also director: it's a thrill to have the intimacy of working with great actors and to know you can still work on the script in rehearsal.\"\nWe discuss which playwright is most likely to match or even exceed his schedule-domination at the National.  I suggest the prolific Richard Bean may one day come snapping at his heals.\n\"Oh there's any number of writers with more vim and energy than me.  I expect someone will emerge from the shadows.\"\nMarber can be forgiven for having made a quiet tour of the three auditoriums on Wednesday night as each of the three plays entertained their audience.  I joined him in the hidden-away director's box at the back of the Lyttelton stalls for part of Three Days in the Country.\n\"It's a wonderfully private place to sit.  You can study the audience reactions, even if it's from behind.  You can't see faces but it's lethally obvious if anyone nods off.\"\nThat seemed unlikely as the audience fell about at the comic scene in which Dr Shpigelsky (Mark Gatiss) offers himself in marriage to Lizaveta (Debra Gillett).  \"It's all in the original Turgenev,\" insists Marber.  \"I just souped up the comedy a bit.\"\nYet when later Lizaveta gives her response, the spectre of tragedy looms in the play once more and the audience isn't laughing.\nPatrick Marber is reluctant to talk much about his next project.  Perhaps in the past decade too many plans got stuck half way.  He says only that it's a screenplay about a married couple.\n\"But what I really want is to write more plays.  That's where I feel I belong - in the theatre.  I didn't do enough of it in the first half of my career and now it's what I want to concentrate on.   I just want to be a bit more productive.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The country has never had a sitting US president visit before, and understandably there's a sense of enormous pride.\nFor the Americans, this is a golden opportunity to gain some leverage at a time when security threats posed by the Somali Islamist group al-Shabab bind both nations together.\nFrom a personal standpoint, it's a time for Mr Obama to build on his legacy here.\nWithout doubt, President Obama is trying to \"recalibrate\" the relationship between America and Kenya after some difficult diplomatic times.\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was up until recently indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for charges relating to a previous election.\nThat proved problematic for the US president, whose envoy warned Mr Kenyatta as he campaigned for the presidency back in 2013 that there would be \"consequences\" as a result of not trying to clear his name first.\nMonths later, Mr Obama delivered a significant snub to Kenya, bypassing the country altogether during his last African tour.\nIt was deeply felt here in Kenya. Ordinary Kenyans saw it as a personal affront, and the diplomatic sidestepping was met with a ratcheting up of anti-Western sentiment by the Kenyan leadership.\nBut the charges against Mr Kenyatta have now been dropped, in part due to the Kenyan government's apparent \"lack of co-operation\" with the court.\nIt would appear that all is forgiven, and the words of warmth have returned.\nMr Kenyatta confirmed as much in a pre-visit briefing, when he made it clear his US guest was expected to meet his deputy, William Ruto, who still has charges from the ICC hanging over his head.\nThe imperative of working to defeat terrorism would appear to trump matters of international justice. In diplomatic speak, they call it \"essential contact\".\nMr Kenyatta said \"the fight against terror will be central\" to bilateral talks, and pointed out that Kenya had \"been working in very close collaboration with American agencies\" and was expecting to \"strengthen\" ties during the visit.\nThat policy of appeasement is certainly something many security watchers in Kenya have sensed.\nPeter Alling'o, from the Institute of Security in Nairobi, believes the US is seeking to restore close relations with Kenya, in order to gain a stronger foothold in the region's security apparatus in the face of al-Shabab attacks.\nIt may also help to ensure a few more contracts go America's way.\nChina and its eastern neighbours now player a bigger role in Kenya - not only in building roads and railways but also in the important area of defence procurement.\nMilitary vehicles and some weapons have an increasingly Eastern flavour here.\nBarack Obama visited Kenya as a senator in 2006. His father was a goat-herder-turned-economist from western Kenya.\nIncluded in his itinerary were a visit to Wajir, a rural area in north-eastern Kenya hit by a severe drought, and a tour of Kibera, a slum area housing at least 600,000 people.\nHe also took an HIV/Aids test at Kisumu, which had one of Kenya's highest rates of HIV prevalence, to encourage local people to do the same.\nDuring the trip, he was asked if he planned to run for president. He said: \"The day after my election to the United States Senate, somebody asked me am I running in 2008. I said at that time, 'No.'\n\"And nothing, so far, has changed my mind.\"\nSo what will the Americans be hoping to get out of bilateral talks on security, and what about the Kenyans?\nKenya will be able to continue to count on the Americans for \"closer military support, training and procurement of hardware\", says Mr Alling'o.\nIn return, by offering a growing sense of \"confidence and trust\" in the Kenyan security forces, he believes the American objective is to \"penetrate the Kenyan intelligence services more deeply\".\nIt is a delicate relationship and one President Obama will have to navigate carefully.\nThe Americans have some misgivings about what many see as the heavy-handed approach applied by Kenyan security forces to the country's Somali community.\nTalk of building walls along the border, and closing the sprawling Dadaab refugee camp, which is home to thousands of Somali refugees, has not impressed the US leadership, as was made clear during Secretary of State John Kerry's recent visit.\nBut President Obama's uncle, Said Obama, who has visited him several times at the White House, told me his nephew's influence across Africa could be far more widespread once he had cast off the shackles and constraints of the presidential office.\nKenya is a proud nation and one that has proven resilient in the face of terrorist attacks, most notably those at the Westgate shopping centre and the assault on Garissa University earlier this year.\nBut the country's leaders are likely to respond better to gentle persuasion rather than public humiliation when it comes to policy matters.\nAnd Mr Obama may be perfectly placed to deliver that.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The UK government is now set to spell out its aims for new customs arrangements.\nBut what is the difference between a free trade area, single market and a customs union?\nYou can be in the EU's Single Market, but not the EU, this is what Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do.\nThe European Union's single market is perhaps the most ambitious type of trade co-operation. That's because as well as eliminating tariffs, quotas or taxes on trade, it also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\nThat is why there has been no limit on the number of French people who can come to the UK, or the number of British people who can live in Spain - but there are limits on Turks or Ukrainians, for example.\nAlso, a single market strives to remove so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - different rules on packaging, safety and standards and many others are abolished and the same rules and regulations apply across the area.\nThere are EU-wide regulations covering a whole host of industries and products on everything from food standards and the use of chemicals to working hours and health and safety. It is an attempt to create a level playing field and a single market; this does not happen in a free trade zone.\nFor goods, the single market was largely completed in 1992, but the market for services remains a work in progress a quarter of a century later. The EU has promised to introduce it many times, but several countries have dragged their feet and it is much more complicated than creating a single market for say, cars or computers. Even so, the City of London dominates financial services in the EU not least because it can do business in every member country.\nThe EU is therefore not just a free trade area - it is a single market.\nBut to stay in the single market, countries have to allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That last one means immigration is difficult if not impossible to control - although the UK might get a special deal to allow some limits.\nMembership of the single market also normally involves making annual payments towards the EU's budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would cross quite a few red lines for many Brexiteers.\nTurkey is part of a customs union with the EU but not in the single market. The deal does not cover food or agriculture, services or government procurement.\nThe EU is not only a single market - it is also a customs union. The countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union.\nOnce goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed.\nIf the UK left the Customs Union but stayed in the Single market, our exporters would  have to contend with what are called 'rules of origin'.\nThese rules are designed to demonstrate that goods that legally originated in the UK - and did not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere - qualify for duty-free entry into the EU.\nFish factor\nThat could be complicated for many companies that import components from around the world to put into finished products made in the UK.\nAlso services are a huge part of the British economy, 78%, and are not totally covered by a customs union because they tend to face \"non tariff\" barriers.\nStill the UK could opt to leave the single market but stay in the customs union, but that does mean it couldn't negotiate free trade deals with other countries, the EU does that.\nIt might also mean paying money to the EU and accepting ECJ judgements when they relate to trade and it is unlikely to cover farm produce or fish since the UK would not be in the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy.\nA customs union does however have one big advantage, it means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross.\nIf we left both the single market and the customs union we could negotiate a free  trade deal with the EU. A free trade area is one where there are no tariffs or taxes or quotas on goods and/or services from one country entering another.\nThe negotiations to establish them can take years and there are normally exceptions.\nSo agriculture and fisheries might be exempted, certain industries protected and some goods may not be covered.\nServices like banking and education also pose a problem in many free trade deals, as the barrier to trading services are not normally tariffs, but so called non-tariff barriers like different rules, standards and qualifications.\nSo the negotiations can be very long and complicated and the result can still leave many barriers to trade.\nThere is a free trade zone in Europe and we helped to create it: EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. It counts Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members, but they now have a very close relationship with the EU; all but Switzerland are part of the single market.\nThe EU also has free trade arrangements with many other countries around the world; so it is not against negotiating one with the UK in principle, but compared with staying in the single market or the customs union this would be the \"hardest\" form of Brexit.

Such bad luck after a day like this - great start, leading the race.\n\"During the safety car, the pedal broke and I couldn't come off the throttle any more.\"\nAsked whether he considered his title hopes over, Rosberg said: \"I don't know.

The pickpockets. And just the sheer overwhelming numbers of people, thronging every platform, forming every queue.\nSo when the whole country seemingly becomes one large crowd it might seem unlikely that China would be shocked by pictures of a large crowd.\nBut then the Guangzhou Railway Station crowd was a particularly special one.\nThe snarl-up began on Monday with bad weather further north causing the cancellation or delay to some services out of Guangzhou.\nAs word spread of the increasingly large throng of waiting passengers, even more people began turning up extra early for their trains and the problem only intensified.\nAt the peak, 100,000 people were crammed shoulder to shoulder on the giant square in front of the station, spilling out into side roads.\n\"We are like dumplings in a bowl,\" one man told me. He faced a three-hour wait to clear security and then, once finally aboard his train, an eight-hour journey home.\n\"I am very tired,\" another young woman said \"but when I think about my mother and father at home I feel warm and I want to be with them sooner.\"\nDespite the extraordinary scenes of congestion, this was as much a picture of railway efficiency and resilience, as chaos and delay.\nDespite more than 1,000 extra police officers being drafted in for the crowds, there was little trouble for them to deal with.\nI saw one passenger slugging a uniformed police officer with his bag, enraged that he had been stopped from climbing over a metal barrier, but for the most part, there was that old, resigned acceptance that all this is part of the fabric of Chinese New Year.\nAnd, by Wednesday, the authorities had begun to get to grips with the problems on the network itself, bringing in extra trains, or diverting passengers to other train stations, and all the while thousands upon thousands of new passengers continue to arrive, shepherded through the concourse in long, snaking lines, through security and onto trains which, for the most part, were kept running to time.\nThis year, for many of the migrant workers who make up a large proportion of the crowds, there is another, far deeper concern than the issue of just another hectic trip home.\nChina's industrial landscape is changing. The factories, once the centrepiece of the economy, are relocating to countries where wages are lower and, in addition, many migrants now see increasing opportunities in the smaller towns and cities closer to their homes.\nSo, many migrants are packing their bags for the last time and deciding that, after travelling home this year, that is where they will stay.\nChina manufacturing shrinks for sixth month in a row\nFactory bosses report that, at the same time as they face falling demand for their products, they find it increasingly hard to man their production lines, even as wage costs rise ever higher, eroding their competitive advantage even further.\nThis major economic shift has been marked by the first fall in China's migrant population in three decades, down by almost 6 million in 2015.\nXu Xifei and Wu Jianying have been migrant workers for more than 10 years, spending most of the year in Guangdong Province while their children stay home in the village.\nThey say the shoe factory where they work is losing out to overseas competition and, with living costs rising fast, it is becoming increasingly hard to make enough money to survive.\n\"Did not President Xi Jinping say that if you work hard and stick to your dreams you will get your reward?\" Mr Xu asks me.\n\"Well we did work hard, we did have a dream, but we have nothing to show for it.\"\nThe backlog of passengers at Guangzhou has now mostly been cleared after extra trains were laid on.\nSo China's crowds of stoical migrants are on the move again, but into an increasingly uncertain future.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Simply exerting enough force on the strap to damage the cable sends a signal to the authorities that the device could be being tampered with.\nPaul says that on the day Mr Mohamed's tag was removed, the device did what it was designed to do.\n\"It detected the interference immediately, it transmitted that alert to us and we notified the relevant authorities well within our contracted turnaround time for raising that alarm,\" he says.\nHowever, by the time the police arrived at the mosque where the tag was removed, he had disappeared.\nOn the same day he went missing, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped a case it had brought against Mr Mohamed and two other TPim subjects for allegedly tampering with their tags. Had they been found guilty, they could have been given prison sentences lasting up to five years.\nHowever, the CPS said they would not be able to prove to a criminal standard that the tags had been deliberately tampered with.\nIn cases where the defendants dispute trying to remove or break a tag, expert witnesses are called to see if they can work out what exactly triggered a tamper alert.\nProf Ross Anderson is an expert in security engineering at the University of Cambridge and he worked on the defence case for the accused TPim subjects.\n\"It turned out that the terror suspects had been given large ankle tags, which essentially contained a mobile phone,\" he tells The Report.\n\"So in effect a strap that had been designed and validated for holding on a curfew tag the size of a wrist watch was being used to hold on something the size and weight of a mobile phone.\"\nProf Anderson says what had shown up as an attempt to tamper with the tag could be the result of the wear and tear, caused by the strap carrying a heavier device.\nBut G4S says it is not aware of any false alerts being given by GPS tags and the suggestion the weight of the devices is a factor is wrong.\nA spokesman says: \"In the limited number of cases where tamper alerts have been raised, and where we have had access to the tag for analysis, we have been able to prove either definite evidence of deliberate interference, or in one case, evidence of damage which would be consistent with falling or catching the device on a hard surface.\n\"Professional specialist forensic examination has revealed no evidence of any defect, wear and tear, fatigue or fitting error.\"\nThe Home Office says the CPS's decision to drop the case against the TPim subjects was not based on the effectiveness of the tags themselves.\nThe Ministry of Justice says a new generation of GPS tags is due to be introduced in 2014 and is currently subject to robust testing.\nPhil Kemp presents The Report on BBC Radio 4 on  Thursday 4 December at 20:00 GMT.

It is almost 14 million sq km, which makes it the fifth-largest continent behind Asia, North America, South America and Africa.\nThis is about 58 times the size of the UK and twice the size of Australia!\nIt is also the world's highest continent, with an average land height of 2,300 m.\nThe temperature on Antarctica has been known to go as low as around √¢ÀÜ‚Äô90√Ç¬∞C.\nBecause it is so cold, the air cannot hold as much moisture so it does not rain very much at all there.\nThis actually means Antarctica is considered to be a desert, but the other deserts that you know are much warmer...!\nThe winds can always blow as strongly as up to 351 km per hour.\nAs it is such an important place for scientific research, at any one time there may be many hundreds scientists spread across the various research stations all over the continent.\nYou will also find tourists there. According to Discovering Antarctica, in the early 1990s, about 5,000 tourists went every year. By 2009-2010, the continent welcomed around 37,000 visitors.\nBut nobody lives there permanently!\nIn the winter, the sea around Antarctica freezes over creating what is called sea ice. This makes the continent almost twice as big in winter.\nThe end of the summer in Antarctica is in March and the end of the winter is in September - opposite to in the UK!\nThis is because Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere, which faces the Sun during our winter time.\nIn 1959, several countries signed an agreement called the Antarctic Treaty, saying that Antarctica would be a peaceful place that they would work together to look after.\nWithout an international agreement like this, people would be free to do what they wanted there.

{"text": "Back in the early 1990s, when I was on my way to join the first British troops despatched for peace-keeping duties to Bosnia, I stayed overnight at a Vienna hotel. In the lobby, there was a series of 19th Century maps of the Hapsburg Empire.\nThere they were, all of the old names - Bosnia Herzegovina, the Croat lands - names, long consigned to the history books, that were now the currency of nightly news reports, marking out the boundaries of this latest tragedy in the Balkans.\nLater, standing in Sarajevo's old Turkish market, one had the clear sense of being in a historic border zone; a frontier between Europe and the old Ottoman lands to the east.\nIt was a reminder that for much of the 19th Century, Western diplomacy had been obsessed with what became known as \"the Eastern Question.\"\nThis was the fear as to what might happen as the Ottoman Empire - then seen as \"the sick man of Europe\" - slowly relinquished its grip on its various possessions.\nWho might step into the breach? One obvious concern was Russia. Britain and France had already fought one campaign to bolster Turkey and limit Russia's influence in the Holy Land - the Crimean War of the 1850s.\nDo you see a pattern here? Again those familiar names and themes; the Crimea; Russian influence in the Middle East.\nTimes change - but geography doesn't, and strategic interests have as much to do with geography as they do with anything else.\nThus, Europe now faces what might be called \"a new Eastern Question\".\nIt is not so much Turkey's weakness that is the problem today; it is maybe more a question of Ankara's over-reach.\nTurkey has seemingly achieved the impossible.\nI remember some years ago interviewing the then Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. Bookish, a former professor, he was the proud architect of Turkey's new foreign policy, one of zero problems with any of its neighbours.\nNow, Mr Davutoglu is Prime Minister. And in the intervening years, Turkey seems instead to have developed problems with almost all of its neighbours and erstwhile regional partners; be it Syria, Israel, and now, crucially, Russia.\nMoscow and Ankara find themselves on different sides in the Syrian crisis; Moscow backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, and Turkey in the vanguard of those countries most eager to see his departure.\nA kind of proxy war has turned hot, with Russia bombing Syrian opposition groups backed by Turkey and encouraging Kurdish forces to press ever closer to the Turkish frontier.\nTurkey's shooting down of a Russian warplane last November - a plane that on best evidence had only briefly intruded into Turkish airspace - worsened the tensions.\nMore recently, the Russian-backed Syrian offensive on Aleppo has sent new waves of refugees heading for the Turkish border and worsened Ankara's fears about Kurdish success.\nThis \"new Eastern Question\" impinges upon Western Europe in two crucial ways. First, Turkey is a member of Nato.\nIf it gets itself into a spat with the Russians, this could have dramatic consequences for the alliance as a whole.\nIt was noticeable at the tail-end of last year that the Nato allies' very public support for Turkey in the wake of the shooting down of the Russian Sukhoi jet, was tempered, at least in private,  by a good degree of amazement and concern that Turkey had chosen to behave so rashly.\nBut there is another security dimension too, and that relates to the great wave of refugees, asylum seekers, call them what you will, that are battering on Europe's doors.\nThey, of course come not just from Syria. But the crisis there and the terrible dislocation that it has produced is an important driving factor.\nTurkey is a conduit for some of this population movement, and this means that the EU must measure its relations with Ankara cautiously.\nThe implicit threat is there. If the Europeans do not help Turkey with this problem, then Ankara could simply open the gates and send a reinforced human wave westwards.\nThis could be one reason why western Europe has been largely mute in the face of the Turkish military's onslaught against its own Kurdish areas.\nAnd it may also be why Turkey's self-serving involvement in Syria has similarly been so little criticised.\nApart from opening some of its air bases to help with the US-led air campaign, Turkey has acted in large part to deal with what it sees as a strategic threat from the Kurds, rather than weighing-in against the so-called Islamic State.\nTurkey is doing pretty much everything it can to upset Moscow. Just a few days ago, Mr Davutoglu visited the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, to discuss \"strategic cooperation\" between Turkey and Ukraine.\nBut bolder Turkish threats to intervene on the ground in Syria - a step that might put them in direct confrontation with the Russians - seem to be just that, threats, at least for now.\nFew analysts are giving much hope to the forthcoming \"ceasefire\" in Syria, seemingly brokered by the US and the Russians.\nThe hope must be that at a minimum it may allow an opportunity for aid to reach some embattled areas.\nBut if the fighting does continue; if the Syrian government and its allies continue to gain ground, Turkey may well get to a point where it feels it has to act.\nThe \"new Eastern Question\" may be delayed, but it isn't going to go away.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The High Negotiations Committee (HNC) proposed holding six months of negotiations with President Bashar al-Assad, accompanied by a full ceasefire.\nMr Assad would then hand over power to a unity government that would run Syria for 18 months and organise elections.\nSyria's deputy foreign minister later insisted Mr Assad would not step aside.\nFaisal Mekdad told the BBC that demands that the country's elected leader be removed were \"crazy\" and \"unbelievable\".\n\"We are saying, let the Syrian people decide their own fate. Their own future without intervention. Don't make preconditions who will rule Syria,\" he said.\nMr Assad has consistently refused to step down since the beginning of the war, which has left more than 250,000 people dead, and correspondents say the recent battlefield successes of his forces have only hardened that view.\nThe HNC's \"Vision for Syria\" was unveiled in London by its general co-ordinator, Riyad Hijab, who defected in 2012 while serving as prime minister.\nHe said the plan envisaged three phases:\nIf the document on a transition in Syria had been produced by the political leaders of a victorious army at the gates of Damascus, it could be seen as an enlightened blueprint for the future.\nBut the regime in Damascus will dismiss it, because President Bashar al-Assad seems more secure in the capital than at any other time since the war started.\nIn 2013, when the chemical attack on the city's rebel-held eastern suburbs seemed certain to provoke American air strikes the regime looked shaky and afraid. But the strikes never came, and since then the president and his men have strengthened their positions. Crucially, Russia has intervened directly on the battlefield. President Assad cannot win as things stand, but he cannot lose either.\nThe war gets more complicated every year. Regional superpowers, and the world's most powerful countries have intervened. Dozens of different, and sometimes overlapping rebel groups operate on the battlefields. All have their own agendas. It's a mini world war. No wonder diplomacy fails.\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister said the plan would test Mr Assad's allies.\nBut Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC he was not optimistic that Russia and Iran were prepared to put the \"necessary pressure\" on the president \"in order to comply with the will of the international community\".\nMr Jubeir will discuss the HNC's blueprint with other foreign ministers from the Friend of Syria group of countries that support the opposition.\nUK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is hosting the meeting, wrote in The Times that there \"was still a chance that this vision can be made to work\".\n\"If the Russians and Americans can together create a ceasefire, then the talks can restart in Geneva with the difference, perhaps, that all sides will by then have seen at least the scaffolding of a post-Assad Syria,\" he added.\nMoscow and Washington, which backs the opposition and insists Mr Assad must go, have so far failed to reach an agreement on a new cessation of hostilities.\nAfter a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in China on Monday, Barack Obama said they had been unable to close \"gaps of trust\".\nUS officials are particularly concerned by the deteriorating conditions in and around Syria's second city, Aleppo, where rebel-held eastern areas are once again under siege after government forces advanced over the weekend.\nOn Monday, more than a 100 people were admitted to hospital following a suspected chlorine gas attack on the rebel-held Sukkari district.

{"text": "The couple had abandoned the house in the middle of the night as the water rose over their shoulders and the floorboards floated loose. In the morning they waded back in to rescue some photographs. Nothing else could be salvaged.\n\"Some of the people in those pictures are not even with us anymore, those are our memories,\" said Ms Lopez, 32. They had already sent their two young daughters to Ms Lopez's mother, on higher ground.\n\"They're safe,\" Mr Fernandez said. \"But we've lost every material possession we owned.\"\nTheir house, on Rippling Water Drive, was one of thousands in the area that flooded on Monday as Hurricane Harvey dumped record rainfall on Houston and the nearby Addicks reservoir filled beyond capacity for the first time in its 70-year history.\nAs the level in the reservoir rose past its 108ft (33m) limit, water began pouring over an emergency spillway. Fearing the dam around the reservoir would fail, the Army Corps of Engineers began to let out 4,000 cubic feet (113 cubic metres) of water per second into Buffalo Bayou, flooding nearby neighbourhoods including Bear Creek.\n\"The flooding here is not just from the rain, the flooding here is because they released the reservoir,\" Ms Lopez said.\n\"They notified us they would do it at 7pm and at 1am they released the water. We didn't have enough time. Now everything is gone. If you walk down to my house now, all you will find is a wreck.\"\nMr Fernandez flicked away his cigarette and, after a final glance towards the house, the couple got in their truck and made their way to Ms Lopez's brother's house.\nThere were just a handful of residents left on Rippling Water Drive on Tuesday morning. An eerie silence had descended over the worst-affected parts of Bear Creek, punctuated only by sporadic calls from volunteer rescue boats and the chop of a military helicopter making low passes overhead.\nAs the water level rose, there were fears that a torrent would wash through. The Addicks and Barker reservoirs, built by the government in the 1940s to hold back excessive rainwater along the bayou, store more than half a billion cubic metres of water between them, and the US Army Corps of Engineers has rated the decaying dams around the reservoirs as \"extremely high risk\".\nThe flooding in the surrounding neighbourhoods would last at least four to five weeks, warned Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist at the Harris County Flood Control District. On Tuesday he advised anyone still there to get out. \"Once the water comes into the street, you aren't going to be able to leave,\" he said.\nIn the Colonies neighbourhoods, just streets away from where water flows from the reservoirs into the bayou, a volunteer army had brought together jeeps, pick-up trucks and military surplus vehicles to rescue stranded residents. Organised on Facebook by two local off-road recovery groups, and manned from a makeshift radio control centre a few miles away, the group scoured the flooded streets for anyone stuck in their home.\nJosh James, 26, waded through chest-high water to get people onto a truck.\nHe helped Christie Mueck and her husband out of their house with their dog. Newlyweds, the couple moved to the neighbourhood just two months ago from Layfayette, Louisiana.\n\"I have five years of research in that house,\" said Ms Mueck, holding back tears. \"Everything's in there. If it washes away, I won't get my PhD.\"\nWith 12 evacuees and five dogs, and its huge wheels completely submerged, the truck began to make its way back to higher ground. It was one of six being operated by the volunteers in the area, Mr James said, along with 40 boats and a host of smaller off-road vehicles.\nAll around the Addicks reservoir, volunteers were out in the water, some well-equipped and tightly organised, others making use of whatever they had to hand. With no work while the nearly oilfield is closed, Anthony Kacala, Bertley Taylor, and Michael Hernandez grabbed a canoe and a rubber dinghy and searched online for trouble spots.\nThe three friends rescued 12 people from flooded homes nearby on Monday night, they said, before loading up Facebook to check where else they might be needed.\nOn another street nearby, Octavio Zambrano, 27, was driving his military surplus jeep around with three friends, offering help to anyone in need. Brian Foreman, 34, came in a boat to rescue his father, then stuck around to help, ferrying a woman back to her house to retrieve medicines and clothes.\nThe fleet of volunteer rescue vehicles went in and out of the worst-affected areas, searching for anyone left behind. The truck containing the Muecks slowly made its way to a staging area. The couple said they would try to connect with family members, or else join the nearly 20,000 people around the city preparing to spend the night in a shelter.\nAs water began pouring out of the Addicks reservoir on Monday, two local schools were transformed into makeshift shelters. By that night they were full and began turning people away.\nSome 1,100 people had crammed into Morton Ranch High School, bedding down along the corridors and in the canteen. The handful of inflatable beds available were given to the elderly and the sick, everyone else slept as best they could on the floor.\nSat at a canteen table on Tuesday, looking shattered, Latonia Buckley held her two infant daughters in her arms. Twenty-four hours earlier, she had put the two girls onto a mattress and floated them out of the house as the water poured in.\nThe family had one more night available at the shelter, then they would have to leave. With her home wrecked, and more water threatening to spill from the reservoir into the neighbourhood, going home was not an option.\n\"We have nowhere else to go, we are facing sleeping in our car tomorrow night,\" she said. \"When we opened the car door earlier, water poured out.\"\nLike many people making a makeshift home at the school, Ms Buckley had no flood insurance. \"It's devastating,\" she said. \"You can't protect your kids, you can't provide for your kids. It's doesn't matter what you have in the bank, you have nowhere to go.\"\nDespite the releases on Monday, water was still pouring over the Addicks reservoir spillway at an uncontrolled rate on Tuesday evening. At the Barker reservoir, the water level was rising and threatening to spill over.\n\"We just don't know exactly how this is going to play out because its never happened before,\" said meteorologist Mr Lindner.\nThe most difficult question for many of those bedding down at Morton Ranch High School for a second night seemed to be one of the most simple: What next?\n\"I really don't know,\" said Ms Buckley. \"Pray, I guess.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Iran has also denied involvement in the attack.\nMs Fein told a local radio station on Tuesday that the draft warrant was \"on file\", and that a previous statement from her office saying that no such draft had been found was \"erroneous\".\nOpposition newspaper Clarin had published a copy of the draft on Monday.\nThe document, dating from June 2014, requested the arrest of President Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman.\nHowever, it was not included in a 300-page report submitted by Mr Nisman to a federal court days before his death.\nUnder Argentine law, the president and the foreign minister could only be arrested if Congress first lifted the immunity granted to them as members of the executive.\nHoracio Verbitsky, one of Argentina's most experienced journalists and human rights investigators, told me in his Buenos Aires flat last week: \"There's no point trying to speculate who killed Nisman, because we just don't know.\"\nMr Verbitsky is, of course, dead right. Alberto Nisman probably alienated many people as, with the zealous attitude of a man on a mission, he put the finishing touches to his controversial report into the 1994 bombing. But that does not mean any of the people he criticised in the report were responsible for his death.\nHaving initially dramatically denied the existence of the draft arrest warrants by ripping up copies of the newspaper that first carried the reports, a government spokesman has now been forced into an embarrassing climb-down, and that does look bad for the president.\nSo does the apparent pressure the government continues to put on case investigators and fringe players by relentlessly commenting on what should be an independent judicial investigation.\nWhat is particularly worrying here, beyond the personal tragedy of Alberto Nisman's death, is not that this happened in Argentina - such murky deeds could happen in any city in any country. It is the fact that most Argentines clearly do not expect their government or its institutions to get to the truth, just as the 1992 and 1994 atrocities remain unresolved.\nWhen Clarin first published the draft warrant, the government reacted angrily, dismissing the report as \"garbage\".\nPresident Fernandez had also originally described Mr Nisman's death as suicide.\nHowever, in a televised speech last week, the president suggested that rogue elements in Argentina's intelligence service had fed Mr Nisman false information and manipulated him.\nShe announced plans to dismantle the Intelligence Secretariat (SI) and called for a special session of Congress to discuss a draft bill to that effect.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The fact-checking website Politifact says the border video is actually from Morocco - and the Trump campaign has since said the use of the footage was intentional and that it was what the US border could eventually look like if it is not adequately secured.\nUp until now, Mr Trump has maintained his position at the top of presidential preference polls thanks to his seemingly unique appeal to a blue-collar segment of the Republican electorate, buttressed by near-nonstop news media coverage of his non-traditional campaign and his often controversial comments.\nMr Trump, in a news release announcing the advert, said that his campaign is currently $35 million (√Ç¬£24 million) \"under budget\". He added that he wasn't sure he needed to spend money on television commercials, but \"I don't want to take any chances\".\nWhile Mr Trump spent about $300,000 on three radio adverts last fall, the release says his new television campaign will cost about $2 million (√Ç¬£1.4 million) a week in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\nAccording to a recent report in the New York Times, however, the Trump campaign has yet to reserve airtime in either state - which casts some doubts about the actual size of the advertising purchase.\nWhat's clear, however, is that Trump's video has once again made him a top story in the political media, generating yet another wave of free publicity.\nHis campaign gave the Washington Post a sneak preview on Sunday, leading to a 1,300-word article that featured Mr Trump talking about the details of the advert design, including his preference for using campaign rally footage instead of the more traditional, candidate-talks-to-the-camera style.\n\"I don't like sitting down and shooting an ad because I don't think you capture the same energy you see at our events,\" he said.\nThe content of the advert has some analysts scratching their heads, however. According to the Atlantic's David Graham, a new television campaign traditionally aims to appeal to voters not already in the candidate's camp.\n\"If the point of these ads is to win over new voters, is a recap of months-old messages the most effective way to do it?\" he asks.\nEven if the advertising purchase does total the $2 million a week that Mr Trump promises, that will - at best - only put him on roughly equal footing with competing candidates in terms of paid media over the coming weeks. A group supporting Texas Senator Ted Cruz has announced a $4 million buy over the coming weeks, for instance, and a political action committee tied to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush's campaign has reserved more than $19m in airtime between now and February.\nOf course, the Bush team has already spent more than $41 million on television advertising, and yet his poll numbers continue to sag. Ohio Governor John Kasich and his affiliated groups have spent $9 million, almost exclusively in New Hampshire, and after an early surge in there, he's now mired in single digits - well behind front-running Trump.\nAccording to NBC News, presidential candidates spent almost $120 million combined on television advertising in 2015, with Mr Trump accounting for only the smallest fraction of that.\nTelevision advertising, at least this election, may be overrated.

But no-one likes to be spied on, especially when it's your friend doing the spying.\nThis latest episode is yet another reminder of how American surveillance programmes are causing friction with allies. It's angered many in Germany, where the issue of snooping is historically a very sensitive one, and many are asking: \"What? Again?\"\nIt wasn't too long ago, after all, that we heard the National Security Agency was spying on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone. After a review into the surveillance programmes, President Obama promised the US wouldn't spy on its friends overseas.\nBut despite requests to be included, Germany isn't part of a non-spying pact the US has with Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The White House will want to do all it can to repair any trust issues over this latest incident, so they can work together in other areas - for example, it needs German support for tougher sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.\nAnalysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Berlin\nThe request by the German government follows increasing frustration that it has failed to get US assurances that spying would cease on German citizens from Chancellor Merkel down.\nShe was shocked to learn that her mobile phone conversations were secretly being monitored while President Obama was greeting her as a friend on his visit to Berlin.\nChancellor Merkel has tried to maintain a balance between condemning America's actions but also maintaining cordial relations. Each revelation has made that balance harder to achieve.\nThis matters because America needs German help on a range of issues from trying to get the world economy out of its difficulties, to finding united Western action on Russia, to dealing with the revelations emanating from Edward Snowden who is currently in Moscow but whom some German lawmakers want to invite to Berlin.\nThe chairman of the Bundestag (parliament) committee overseeing the secret service said the action had been taken because of America's spying on German politicians and its failure to co-operate and provide adequate responses.\nThe US has not denied allegations that a German intelligence agency employee arrested last week was passing secret documents to the US National Security Agency (NSA).\nHowever, the latest reports that an employee within the defence ministry was also spying for the US were considered more serious. Although no arrest was made, searches were carried out on Wednesday at the ministry and elsewhere.\nThe US and Germany have been close allies for decades but relations were hit last year when it emerged that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been monitored by the NSA.\nThe White House declined to comment on the matter but said the security and intelligence relationship with Germany \"is a very important one and keeps Germans and Americans safe\".\n\"It is essential that co-operation continue in all areas and we will continue to be in touch with the German government in appropriate channels,\" spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.\nOctober 2013: German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls US President Barack Obama after revelations that the US may have spied on her mobile phone\nJune 2014: Germany announces an investigation into the claims\n4 July 2014: A suspected US spy said to be working for the German intelligence agency is arrested\n9 July 2014: A second case emerges as searches are carried out at the defence ministry\n10 July 2014: German government orders expulsion of CIA official\nOn Thursday, Mrs Merkel said spying on allies was a \"waste of energy\".\n\"We have so many problems, we should focus on the important things,\" she said.\n\"In the Cold War maybe there was general mistrust. Today we are living in the 21st Century. Today there are completely new threats.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the information that the US appeared to have gained from the suspected espionage was \"laughable\" but the political damage was \"disproportionate and serious\".\nThe scale of the US agency's surveillance was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the US and is now a fugitive in Russia.\nThe German intelligence official arrested last week was alleged to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee investigating the NSA spying scandal.\nWhen Mrs Merkel visited the White House in May, President Barack Obama sought to assure her and the German people they were not subject to \"continual surveillance\" by the US.\nHe said \"complicated issues\" were involved but he anticipated that the matter would be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Nothing unusual there, you might think.\nBut one writes about Allah and her mosque, the other about her synagogue and the Star of David.\nThe two met at a Washington DC youth slam poetry event and write and communicate about their faiths in ways that aim to engage and provoke their audiences.\nIt's a type of dialogue that will be much needed now, after the killings in Paris and the attack on a kosher supermarket there.\nThe young poets were taking part in a session at Limmud, which has been likened to a Jewish Edinburgh festival, Hay and Glastonbury rolled into one and is held on Warwick University campus just before New Year.\nLimmud (from the Hebrew word for \"learning\") began life in 1980 and now has some 50 offshoots around the world.\nIn the UK this year, it drew over 2,500 people from 27 countries - all the more remarkable given the relatively small size of the UK's Jewish community, which numbers under 300,000 people, a community with close links to Jewish families in Paris and elsewhere in France.\nThe question of identity and security was tackled in many of Limmud's discussions, as Judaism and the role, lives and place of Jewish people in Europe and across the world was examined from every perspective, from the historical to the feminist, and from the religious to the secular.\nEven before the Paris attacks, there were worries over a sharp rise in anti-Semitism in the UK and mainland Europe in 2014, during and after the latest conflict in Gaza.\nIn France, the killing of Jewish schoolchildren in Toulouse in 2012 by a Frenchman of Algerian descent, and the murders of four people inside the Jewish museum in Brussels by another Frenchman of Algerian descent in May 2014 heightened fears amongst the Jewish community in France and elsewhere.\nThe uneasy mood was articulated by BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, at a conference in Jerusalem last year.\nHe said he had \"never felt so uncomfortable as a Jew in the UK\", as figures showed that anti-Semitic incidents in Britain also rose to record annual levels in 2014.\nMr Cohen said levels of hatred were on the rise across Europe.\n\"You've seen the number of attacks rise, you've seen murders in France, you've seen murders in Belgium. It's been pretty grim actually.\"\nThe killings at Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week have further focused attention on radical Islamism in Europe, and the safety of Jewish communities in France, Germany and the UK.\nAt one Limmud seminar, Michael Whine, of the Community Security Trust (CST), which seeks to protect Jewish communities and offer advice on security, sought to place last summer's figure in a wider European perspective, citing research by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research showing that Jewish people in the UK felt safer than those in France.\nHowever, CST figures still showed a significant rise in both verbal and physical attacks on Jewish people in the UK in 2014 compared with 2013, with 543 recorded in July and August 2014 alone - although the percentage of violent attacks - 7% - did not rise in the UK, unlike France.\nOver the weekend, Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, joined the march in Paris, and the memorial service at the Great Synagogue there.\nHe said he was pleased to have the opportunity \"to express solidarity with the people of France and the French Jewish Community\".\n\"We stand together at this time challenging time.\"\nThe Senior Rabbi to the Movement for Reform Judaism in the UK, Laura Janner-Klausner, also went to Paris.\nShe travelled with a Muslim colleague to join the march with well over a million others, to show solidarity with the French, of all faiths and none.\nShe said they wanted to demonstrate that all communities could work together to counter the hatred and extremism manifested in the attacks last week.\n\"Some parts of the Jewish community in Paris were still suffering from the trauma of what happened there,\" she said.\n\"Some had heard the shots being fired at Charlie Hebdo, so they were frightened.\n\"Some were tearful, and emotional. But they were not saying, 'Now we are going to pack our bags and leave.'\n\"They were saying,' This is our home, and we don't want the narrative to be that we are leaving because of this.'\"\nNonetheless, she said that anti-Semitism in France was more obvious and public than in the UK.\n\"There, the anti-Semitism can be palpable, whereas in Britain what we generally experience is a wonderful sense of integration.\n\"This is where we live, this is where we want our children to go to school and grow up. If the worst happened in the UK, which it could, this is still our home.\"\nMany believe that the legacy of France's colonial history in north Africa still drives much of the anti-Semitism evident there.\nSome Muslim immigrants from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia - even now in the second and third generation - continue to feel excluded from the mainstream in France.\nMany live very separate lives in the grimmer suburbs around Paris and other major cities, where unemployment is high and prospects are often limited.\nJewish immigrants to France from north Africa often integrated faster and have sometimes enjoyed better economic prospects, leading to tensions between the two.\nAt the same time, both communities often live side by side, but remain in many cases divided by the perception amongst some younger Muslims that while they struggle to be accepted in France as truly French, Jewish families have not had as much of an uphill task.\nYet some 7,000 French Jewish people chose to leave for Israel last year, a record number, thanks partly to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks, although a dearth of jobs and economic stagnation may also have played its part.\nSome French Jewish people have also moved to London, to seek work or education there.\nIn the UK this week, the CST said there would be increased police patrols in Jewish areas, as a visible reassurance to the community.\nThe hope is that it is only a precaution, not a necessity, with Jewish-Muslim relations in the UK enjoying a more harmonious history than in France.\nIn the UK, Justin Cohen, news editor of the Jewish News, says that nonetheless: \"British Jews are still on edge following the huge increase in anti-Semitism last summer, and the horrific events in Paris have heightened tensions.\n\"Still, there is a clear difference between that and the levels of hate faced by the community in France.\n\"And it is absolutely not the case that British Jews are packing their bags to leave, as is the case across the Channel.\n\"Nevertheless, members of the British Jewish community are all too aware that, alongside US, British and Israeli sites, Jewish ones are high up in the target list for Islamist fundamentalists.\n\"Jewish schools and institutions will be going about their usual business today, but with this and fresh calls for vigilance uppermost in their minds.\"\nThe worry remains that the virulent strain of Islamist extremism that exploded on to the world stage again so violently in France last week is an ideology that can be used by extremists anywhere to seek to divide communities, different faiths and societies across the world.\nThe challenge now for many is how to strengthen interfaith ties to resist that attempt.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged.\nBut it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.\nThe WFP has identified some 592,700 people in 19 besieged areas that may need to receive aid by air.\nBut the operating conditions are challenging, it says. Many besieged locations are in built-up, urban areas with no suitable space for a drop zone. High-altitude drops are not possible in those areas because of the risk of harming people on the ground.\nThe UN food agency says airdrops are always a last resort as access by land is more efficient.\nMeanwhile, aircraft from the US-led coalition dropped ammunition to rebels in the town of Marea, in Aleppo province, the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\nIt was not clear if weapons were also delivered.\nRebels are fighting militants from so-called Islamic State (IS), who cut off supply routes between Marea and Azaz, both under rebel control, near the Turkish border.\nThe area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones.\nThe US is also supporting an offensive by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), made up by Kurdish and Arab fighters, against IS-held Manbij.\nThe Syrian Observatory also said Islamist insurgents, including from the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front, and government forces have attacked each other near Khan Touman, in southwest Aleppo.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The dangers of allowing ungoverned space, where militant groups have launched attacks on neighbouring Israel, ought to have been obvious to anybody in Cairo, but it was only the killing of 16 of their border guards on Sunday that finally prompted action.\nThe inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula, notably some of its Bedouin tribes, are a heavily armed force that, it would seem, the military rulers of Egypt who had recently stood down were reluctant to challenge.\nNow, in one of those bitter paradoxes of power in the Middle East, it has fallen to Mohammed Morsi, the recently elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood to clamp down on militants who claim Islamic legitimacy for their attacks.\nIt might be argued that Mr Morsi is the ideal man to take these wayward tribes in hand - since he has both a democratic mandate and some degree of backing from Egypt's religious establishment.\nThere is also a good deal of cynicism in Cairo about the tribes' professed religious motivations, since they are also widely believed to be involved in smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people.\nEven so, Tuesday's raid on Touma, close to the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean Sea, may indicate the opening of a bloody new chapter for Sinai. The raid, in which helicopters fired missiles into the township, had an aspect of communal punishment about it, or reprisal for Sunday's loss of border guards.\nInevitably there will be some who want revenge against the security forces. Since the armed bands on the peninsula are thought to possess hundreds of light weapons, as well as technicals (pick-up trucks mounting heavy machine guns), and multiple rocket launchers they have considerable ability to cause trouble.\nThe bombing of several hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005 claimed 84 lives was blamed by security officials on elements within the same Bedouin tribes, claiming ties with al-Qaeda.\nIt underlines the degree to which the country's Red Sea tourist industry is vulnerable to reprisals.\nMore recently the Israelis have accused the same groups of several deadly attacks along their border with Egypt. These created great tension in an area that had been peaceful for decades, and prompted the Israelis to start building a barrier through the desert in an attempt to prevent more infiltration.\nToday the Israelis have reacted with satisfaction to the new security crackdown, and have given their agreement to military reinforcements going into Sinai (as it required under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries that sought to de-militarise the peninsula).\nMr Morsi meanwhile faces the accusation that has been used in the past against those who have taken similar measures, of acting as Israel's policeman.\nThe shooting of so many Egyptian soldiers at the weekend has allowed the president to present this action as a response to a challenge to national authority rather than an attack on Israel.\nBut the scope both for serious escalation in this violence and for political difficulties for the new president will make the Sinai Peninsula a key place to watch in coming months.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

From then, we noticed he would be a great athlete.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGrowing up alongside brother and sister Sadiki and Sherine, Wellesley says his son was \"very jovial\" and despite a few problems he did \"nothing out of the ordinary for a child\".\nMeanwhile, at William Knibb High School, a young Usain was more interested in playing cricket than hitting the athletics track,  saying he was \"so in love\" with the sport \"he didn't want to do anything else\".\nThe teenager eventually heeded the advice of PE teacher Lorna Thorpe, who told Bolt he must focus on athletics if he wanted to reach the top as he had \"a gold mine in his legs\".\n\"It's a passion. You ask Usain, he'll tell you that. It's just a passion,\" she added.\nAnd the champion certainly appreciates his teacher's influence now.\n\"She's like a second mum,\" he said.\n\"When I was in high school she looked out for me, she was always on me in school, making sure everything was OK, always focused. So she played a very big part for me.\"\nHowever, acting principal at the time Lorna Jackson had to teach the teenager, who was an \"average but popular student\", a thing or two about mixing with the opposite sex.\n\"A happy-go-lucky guy. Everyone liked Usain,\" she told the Sunday Telegraph.  \"I remember in grade nine there was a girl, there was some liking going on there, and she was helping him with his writing.\n\"And then we were talking in class about girlfriends and boyfriends and someone said Usain had a girlfriend at a neighbouring school. I said, don't write anything else for him!\"\nJackson also taught Bolt Spanish: \"I remember him coming back to the school and telling the children, learn your Spanish because I remember Miss Jackson saying to me, you, Usain, are going to be going places and you need to make sure you learn Spanish.\n\"He was telling them he went down to South America and he saw some beautiful girls, and it came back to him that if he'd paid more attention to his lessons he would have been able to communicate better.\"\nBy the time he was 15, Bolt was \"the talk of the world of athletics\" after racing to the 200m World Junior Championship title in Jamaica in 2002 against men four years his senior.\nIt made him the youngest ever world junior gold medallist, while he also won the International Association of Athletics Federation's Rising Star Award.\nAmerican colleges were quick to offer the young star sports scholarships, as were sports agencies looking to tie the future Olympic hero down to a contract.\nIrishman Ricky Simms was a young, ambitious sports agent who had taken over at one of the premier sports management companies in the world, and he was the man who won the Jamaican's signature.\n\"After graduating from high school, Jamaican athletes traditionally go to university in the United States and spend four years there before they turn professional,\" explained Simms.\n\"He decided he was going to turn pro in 2003 rather than go to university and it was recommended that he to talk to us.\"\nBut Bolt's early flawless performances on the track were not quite so composed off it, with the teenager sometimes getting so nervous before big races he would be brought to tears.\n\"When I talked with him he stopped crying and I think he thought about it and he said: 'OK mom, I'm going to do my best',\" his mum Jennifer told CNN about those junior championships in 2002.\n\"I said the Lord is with you and I'm gonna pray for you and he just goes out there and when I saw the race I saw him in front and the crowd started to shout his name.\n\"I think that helped to motivate him because he could hear the crowd in the stadium shouting.\"\nThe future was at Justin Gatlin's feet as the American, having already served a doping suspension, took the 100m Olympic crown as a 22-year-old in 2004 and a teenager named Usain Bolt was eliminated in the 200m heats.\nBy the time the 2008 Beijing Games came around Brooklyn-born Gatlin was in the middle of a four-year doping ban and Bolt had truly arrived on the scene, smashing the American's winning time in Athens and scooping his first three gold medals across the sprint disciplines.\nGatlin took bronze as Bolt defended his 100m title four years later in London, and at last year's World Championships their rivalry was renewed once more when the Jamaican edged the American by 0.01 of a second.\n\"He proved that when he's down, he can come back up, and when he's up, he's up the highest,\" Gatlin told NBC.\n\"That's the kind of guy you want to set your sights on and go after. He gave me a vision of where I needed to be.\n\"When you think about track and field, you think about Gatlin and Bolt. We are showmen. We are true competitors.\"\nHaving met at the World Championships in Beijing their mothers are now friends and, despite a fierce on-track rivalry, the sons enjoy each other's company away from competition too.\n\"Bolt has a good time,\" said Gatlin, 34, about a couple of nights out the pair have shared.\n\"We are able to relax and have fun outside of track and field, but when we step on the track, we want to beat each other.\"\nBolt's Jamaican team-mates past and present are by no means slouches, Asafa Powell twice set the 100m world record between 2005 and 2008 while former world champion Yohan Blake took silver in both the 100m and 200m at London 2012.\nBut while Jamaica's men's sprint team know the chance of a 4x100m gold is greatly improved by Bolt's place in the quartet, their own individual medal aspirations are not.\nHe is the first athlete to win consecutive Olympic gold medals in both the 100m and 200m and has won seven world titles in those races since 2009, only missing out on the 2011 100m crown because he was disqualified for a false start.\nSo what's it like being one of the world's best, in the presence of a history-making great?\nPowell will not race in Rio, but the 33-year-old has said how important Bolt's presence at major championships is to the sport.\n\"It's good for the sport to have him since he's the world number one and world record holder,\" Powell said in 2015. \"It's good to have him in the race to draw the crowd and excitement.\n\"Everyone wants to beat him. He is very strong and he is very fast.\"\nPowell has in the past toyed with trying to play mind games to get an advantage on his team-mate, but admits their friendship comes first.\n\"There are times when I said to myself 'I'm going to make our rivalry like a Tyson and Holyfield match' but I just can't find the energy to put out that kind of trash talk,\" he said in the Daily Mirror.\n\"I really wouldn't mean it. We've been friends before the world record and Olympic Games and nothing has changed, he has only got a lot more famous.''\nAnd when Powell finished a disappointing seventh at the World Championships last year, Bolt responded with a supportive message for his compatriot.\n\"Bro just keep strong. Ppl don't get this journey and sacrifice we all put into this,\" he tweeted.\nAs Blake, three years Bolt's junior, was coming on to the scene, the future Olympic champion was already acting as a mentor to his teenage prodigy.\nBolt was in the crowd as Blake won a youth race in Jamaica in 2008, telling the youngster who had recently joined his training group not to burn himself out, adding \"you still have a big career to come\".\nBlake told Newsweek he could not believe Bolt knew who he was: \"I was just so appreciative [of his advice],\" he said. \"You know, that's just the kind of guy that he is.\"\nWhen speaking to BBC Sport, Blake added: \"He always sets the bar high, which I really like. As a youngster you have to aim high.\"\nGlen Mills was head coach of the Jamaican national team for 22 years, before moving on to concentrate on working with his sprinters at Racers Track Club in Kingston, Jamaica.\nHe has coached athletes to more than 100 world and Olympic medals, with that tally healthily advanced by one Usain Bolt.\nAfter his disappointing Olympic debut in Athens, Bolt turned to Mills and the man with more than 42 years' coaching experience set about shaping a champion.\n\"Usain is an extremely gifted athlete,\" Mills told Speed Endurance.\n\"When I started working with him, one of the things that stood out like a sore thumb was his poor mechanics. He was running behind the centre of balance. This resulted in a negative force against his forward drive and it was affecting other areas.\"\nMills said Bolt's style was continually causing him hamstring problems.\n\"We set about doing drills,\" he added. \"Then we took videos of his workouts and broke them down on the screen in slow motion to show him exactly what he was doing. I would draw diagrams and show him the position that we are working to achieve.\"\nBolt's determination to work on the areas that were hampering him turned him into a global star, and he has done it all with a smile on his face.\n\"Usain works very hard,\" added Mills in the Evening Standard. \"But he also mixes it with his juvenile character. People need to know he takes his training and his races very seriously.\"\nMills also has supreme confidence in his most decorated athlete.\n\"We take all competitors with a level of seriousness and I don't see Gatlin as a joke,\" he said before last year's World Championships. \"But the truth of the matter is Usain at his best doesn't have much to worry about.\n\"Those kinds of things don't affect us in any way because Usain and myself know what we can get him to do when he's fully fit and ready.\"\nSo what's it like to compete against a 6'5\" 'fully fit and ready' Bolt?\n\"We were in awe, man, we were in awe of what just happened,\" Darvis Patton, who finished eighth in Beijing, told Sports Illustrated about the night Bolt won his first Olympic gold and smashed the world record in the process, lowering it to 9.69secs.\n\"The way it happened. The dude ran nine-six. Celebrating.\"\nMarc Burns of Trinidad and Tobago added: \"I was just getting ready to breast the tape, and I heard this huge roar and I thought, Oh, could be an upset. Then I looked up and Bolt is halfway around the turn, celebrating.\"\nThe Bolt family has been based in Trelawney, where dad Wellesley still works in the local shop, for more than half a century and the parish's most famous son is always welcomed on his return.\nBest friend Nugent Walker says Bolt \"has never forgotten where he comes from\" with the star's foundation providing a bus and computers for his old school, while also paying to rebuild a health centre in the village of Sherwood Content.\n\"Jamaica has kept him very grounded,\" he added in the Telegraph. \"People see the very confident athlete on the track and some people might misunderstand that. But he wants to be the best person he can.\n\"His parents instilled the key values: respecting people, caring for people, he's kind to a fault - too kind some might say.\n\"I don't think he realises he's a celebrity. One time we were staying in France and he came down to the lobby and there were all these people outside, and he said to the bellman, who are they waiting for? The bellman said, they're waiting for you.\"\nMum Jennifer hopes he chooses to spend plenty of time with the family once he hangs up his spikes, and that retirement will bring a little less attention.\n\"He will be able to move around as he wants,\" said Jennifer. \"People always want to get close to him, not to hurt him, but just get close to him.\"\nJennifer insists Usain is still the same character as the one who made his junior World Championships debut in 2002 - and still listens to his parents\nBut Wellesley, who takes credit for his son's dance moves, says success has made the sprinter \"more of an entertainer\".\nWith that in mind, Jennifer thinks an ambassadorial role is in the offing.\n\"I would like him to be an ambassador to track and field because he brings fun to the sport,\" she said. \"After he leaves, you don't know who will take over his role. Without him, it would be really boring.\"\nAs for adding to the Bolt family? Mum and dad are confident they will be able to add the grandparent tag before long, but Bolt is keeping quiet on the identity of the woman he has been dating for the past two years.\n\"That's why he wants to retire early,\" said Wellesley. \"Because he wants to put his family together.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.\nWorkless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.\nPeople may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.\nThe data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.\nThis means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.\nSome 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.\nChildren's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.\nHowever, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.\nThey said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.\nThe proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK.

{"text": "His inclusion in the England Lions squad for the January tour of South Africa is great news, coming on the back of what have perhaps been England's most difficult few weeks of the entire period.\nTrott has fought very hard to get into this position. When he first left Australia with what were later clarified as anxiety issues, many thought that his England career was over.\nWhen his first attempt at a comeback was aborted in April, I was told by someone close to the Warwickshire batsman that the next step would be a quiet return playing some club cricket in South Africa.\nThe right-hander will play in the country of his birth, but on merit after receiving recognition from the selectors as a result of a very strong second part of the summer that saw him accumulate 628 first-class runs and average 54.22 as Warwickshire reached the final of the One-Day Cup.\nBecause of his South African roots and the decision for Trott to only be on tour for one three-day warm-up match and two first-class four-day games against South Africa A, this trip should not hold many difficulties for him.\nHe will also have the help of Andy Flower, who was in charge of England in Australia and will be working with the Lions in South Africa.\nThe experience in Australia will have taught Flower how to spot any problems that Trott may encounter, while I am sure the Zimbabwean will make it absolutely clear that the player must report any concerns he has.\nHaving taken the incredibly difficult decision to go public with his problems on leaving Australia, Trott no longer has to operate in secret, or fear embarrassment. Similarly, Flower knows he can keep a close eye on Trott without the worry of over-imposing himself.\nThrough all of this, representing England again will be on Trott's mind. Since he last played international cricket, Alastair Cook's side have moved on, with younger players like Gary Ballance and Joe Root doing very well, but there is still room for the 33-year-old's experience, especially with 17 Test matches scheduled over the next year or so.\nIn cricketing terms, the selectors may want to see Trott deal with some hostile fast bowling before they consider bringing him back, especially as it was an onslaught from Mitchell Johnson that exposed his anxiety issues to those watching from a distance.\nThere is also the question of where Trott would fit in to the current Test side, but that simply adds an extra layer of intrigue to this Lions tour.\nTrott's old spot of number three has been filled very successfully by Ballance, while Ian Bell and Root both played well at numbers four and five.\nHowever, Trott has long been talked of as a potential opener and there is a place at the top order available alongside Alastair Cook.\nIn seven Test matches over the summer, Sam Robson failed to make that place his own and the Middlesex man is battling with Yorkshire pair Adam Lyth and Alex Lees, as all three join Trott on the tour of South Africa.\nAt the moment, though, Trott should just play, without the thinking about the future, spots in the Test side, or a potential meeting with Australia next summer.\nThere any number of reasons why a spot could come available in the England line-up - injuries, a loss of form, a change of balance to the team - but that is secondary to his Lions call-up less a year after his international career looked to be over.\nThat it is not is great credit to him and to Warwickshire. This return to the England fold is the result of an approach that has seen Trott left alone to find his own way.\nIt must continue through the Lions tour to South Africa and beyond.\nJonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "And the guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) were well placed to profit from the illegal drugs trade.\nToday, there are still small fields of bright green coca cut from the virgin jungle, but the rebels have found a more lucrative, and far safer, source of income: gold.\nIt was here the US military aid package, known as Plan Colombia, which has amounted to some $8bn (√Ç¬£5bn) since 1999, was concentrated.\nSince 2000, fleets of spray planes have dropped glyphosate chemicals over the coca bushes, managing to reduce, but never eradicate, drug production.\nWhat the chemicals have done is push local farmers into the new, informal industry of gold mining.\n\"We estimate that the Farc here make 800m pesos ($450,000) a week from illegal gold mining,\" said Jhimmy Calvache, the acting mayor of Mocoa in Putumayo province.\nColombia has vast gold deposits, especially along the rivers that wash down from the Andes Mountains.\nIt was gold that drew the Spanish conquistadors here in the 16th Century, and now, with prices high for precious metal, gold fever has returned.\nMechanical diggers operate along the riverbeds and banks in Putumayo, protected by heavily armed rebels who allow no access to the sites and impose huge \"taxes\" on production.\nIn March, police sought to send in investigators to find out how much gold was being extracted.\nThey ran into trigger-happy guerrillas and it was decided that, without massive army support, there was no chance of making any meaningful inquiries. The operation was abandoned.\nWhile the illegal exploitation of gold in Putumayo is still in its infancy, it is well developed in other parts of the country.\nIn the northern department of Antioquia, the Farc have established a series of extortion schemes on the gold miners, legal and illegal.\nFor every mechanical digger that enters their territory, the rebels charge an initial \"tax\" of up to $3,000 and another $2,000 per piece of heavy machinery for every month of operation.\nIn the gold-rich municipality of Anori in Antioquia, authorities believe there are up to 120 diggers operating, earning the local Farc unit a monthly income of at least $240,000. There are 125 municipalities in Antioquia.\n\"Gold is now more lucrative than coca,\" says Antioquia Governor Sergio Fajardo.\nThe guerrillas are not just extorting money but running some mining operations themselves or demanding a percentage of all production.\nThe advantage of gold is that it is perfectly legal to transport and sell, unlike cocaine.\nIndeed, legally registered mines have become a favourite acquisition for drug traffickers as well, as they are perfect vehicles for laundering money.\nThe mining companies can claim any amount of gold is being extracted and then traffickers put all their money from cocaine sales through the books.\nOn condition of anonymity, a mine worker in Anori played the recording on his telephone of a call he said was from the Farc demanding payment.\n\"Don't try my patience this month,\" growled a low voice, \"don't make me look for you, or the machines will be burnt and you may become a military objective [this is guerrilla speak for becoming a target for assassination].\"\nHe paid, and continues paying, even during the rainy season when the rising water levels make extracting gold from the river bed almost impossible.\nIn Putumayo, there is clear evidence that the rebels are strengthening themselves thanks to the cash from gold.\nIn the remote municipality of Puerto Guzman, 400 people were called in April by the rebels to attend a political meeting, where they said they were forced to listen to Marxist doctrine.\nThese meetings are increasingly common.\nIn Piamonte, accessible only by canoe, the rebels run football tournaments for the young people, to hook them in and prepare them for recruitment.\n\"We had a rebel incursion last month,\" said Piamonte local councillor Carlos Martinez, who moved his children away for fear of Farc recruitment.\n\"The guerrillas came into the town, to within 30 metres of the police station. The policemen did nothing, they never left their base.\"\nThe police station is a series of bunkers connected by trenches. Resupply is done by US-supplied Blackhawk helicopters.\nTheir landing is covered by a helicopter gunship hovering over the town, the gunner's finger never leaving the trigger of his machine gun that is capable of firing 800 rounds a minute.\nA young policeman offered a few words from the barrier to the base, refusing to come out or let me in.\n\"We don't get much co-operation from the local community here. We never leave the town,\" he said, glancing nervously at the high ground within sniper range.\nPutumayo used to produce up to 100 tonnes of cocaine a year. Now it produces around 40 tonnes.\nBut the shortfall in Farc revenue has been more than made up with illegal mining of gold.\nAs Colombia's conflict enters its 49th year, the 9,000-strong rebels are looking to gold to fund new offensives against the state.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

However, that will depend on reaching agreement on a new fiscal framework and final passage of the Scotland Bill.\"\nAmong the other measures proposed by Mr Swinney were:\nGreater controls over income tax are among the measures contained in the Scotland Bill which is currently being scrutinised by Westminster, but these will not come into force until 2017 at the earliest.\nMr Swinney said that the Scottish government aimed to set out its longer-term plans on income tax ahead of the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament in March of next year.\nHe said that the Scottish government's aim was to focus on tackling inequality and boosting productivity in order to \"create the foundations for a stronger and more inclusive economy\".\nBut he said that would need to be delivered within a \"significantly constrained\" public spending environment.\nMr Swinney added: \"By 2020 our budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms than when the Conservatives came to power. That is the equivalent of one pound in every eight that we spend being cut by Westminster by 2020.\"\nHe said that Land and Buildings Transaction tax, which replaced the stamp duty charge on property sales in Scotland, will remain the same for most transactions.\nBut he added: \"The exception to this is for buyers purchasing an additional residential property - such as a second home or a buy-to-let - worth more than ¬£40,000, who will face an additional charge of 3% of the value.\nMr Swinney said this was \"proportionate and fair\", adding the new levy \"seeks to ensure that the opportunities for first-time buyers to enter the housing market in Scotland remain as strong as they possibly can be\".\n¬£13bn\nfor 2016//17\n¬£500m additional spending for 2016/17\n6.5% increase on 2015/16\nHe also announced that he was allocating more than ¬£500m to NHS budgets, which he said would result in total planned spending of nearly ¬£13bn next year - an increase of 6.5% on the comparable figure for 2015/16.\nBut he warned that Scotland's ageing population meant that additional funding alone was not enough to equip it properly for the future.\nMr Swinney added: \"To really protect our NHS, we need to do more than just give it extra money - we need to use that money to deliver fundamental reform and change the way our NHS delivers care.\"No change in Scottish income tax rate\n¬£9,545m\nRevenue funding for the country's 32 councils\n¬£250m - new money for health and social care\n¬£70m - to continue the council tax freeze\n¬£88m - to maintain teacher numbers at 2015 levels\nTo this end, he said an extra ¬£45m would be invested in improvements to primary care, with a further ¬£200m funding six new treatment centres.\nMr Swinney said: \"This will equip the NHS to carry out increased numbers of hip and knee replacements and cataract operations, in a way that does not simply add pressure to our emergency hospitals.\"\nThe draft budget is normally presented in September, but was delayed this year to take into account the Westminster spending review in November.\nBy BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor\nIn practice, John Swinney was holding steady in this budget - for understandable reasons. Firstly, there are big changes pending: reforming council tax, reviewing business rates, extra tax powers from the Smith Commission.\nAll that plus there is still no final deal on the Fiscal Framework which will accompany the Smith powers - although one is now firmly forecast for February.  All that adds up to a climate of arithmetical and political uncertainty.\nBut secondly there are elections to the Scottish Parliament in May. Mr Swinney does not lack fortitude but it would have taken a particularly courageous Finance Secretary (in the Yes Minister mode) to hike income tax, at the first time of asking under new powers, weeks before those polls.\nRead more analysis from Brian.\nScottish Labour's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"This is the most important budget since devolution, delivered by a party who promised to stand up for Scotland against Tory austerity.\n\"But it doesn't deliver fairer taxes, a long-term plan for Scotland or an anti-austerity alternative. Local services like our schools, roads and care of the elderly will face massive cuts.\"\nMurdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives said Mr Swinney had chosen not to increase the resources available to him by levying additional taxes.\nHe added: \"For years, the finance secretary has portrayed himself as a prisoner of Westminster austerity, but now that he has been given the key to the door of his cell, he has decided not to use it.\n\"So I trust we will hear no more from the SNP about austerity and Westminster cuts, when the party itself has made the choice not to increase the size of the budget available.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney \"has spent his entire political life campaigning for more tax powers. And what does he do when he gets them? The answer is nothing, no change, same rate and the same as in England.\n\"John Swinney cannot tell Scotland that he is rejecting austerity when he is not raising a penny more even though he has the new tax powers to do something about it.\"\nCosla president David O'Neill said the cuts to council funding \"cannot be laid at Westminster's door this time around\".\nHe added: \"A cut of 3.5% is catastrophic for jobs and services within Scottish local government - because the harsh reality is that it actually translates to real job cuts that hit real families, in real communities throughout Scotland.

{"text": "Another parliamentary vote - after a bad tempered debate - has ticked some more of the boxes required by the eurozone.\nSo what next for Greece?\nFirst let's be clear - that third financial rescue package has still to be negotiated.\nSo much political blood has been shed just to get the talks started, surely, you might think, Greece and the eurozone wouldn't let a deal slip from their grasp after all that.\nPerhaps. Though the next few weeks of negotiations will be hard.\nSo let's assume the third programme will be agreed.\nThe precise contents are still to be negotiated but it will include many policy commitments that the Greek government and much of the population will hate.\nThere will be targets for the government's finances, specifically for a primary surplus - that means the government must take in more in tax revenue than it spends, putting to one side the interest it is paying on the national debt.\nGreece has managed primary surpluses for the last two years. But after a renewed decline in the economy starting at the end of last year - and severely aggravated by the bank closures this month - it will be very hard to repeat that this year.\nTo achieve that aim will mean more austerity.\nThere has been massive austerity already. The adjustment to the government finances has been extraordinary: there is a measure called the structural budget balance: that went from a deficit of 18.6% of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 2.2% in 2013. (These figures take out the impact of the economic cycle on taxes and public spending and so show - imperfectly - the effort a government has put in to change its financial position.)\nThe programme will be subject to continuous monitoring and it's sure to lead to further episodes of tension between Greece and the creditors, and in all probability more occasions when payments are delayed because of slippage in the implementation of the policies.\nWe had a flavour of the political difficulties the government will face with implementation over the last 24 hours. A statement from a public sector union said: \"We will continue our battle so that the new barbaric bailout does not pass and is overturned.\"\nEurozone governments also expect Greece to make a commitment to a wide range of reforms covering, among other things, industrial action, collective bargaining, and opening closed professions. There's more potential there for political difficulties in implementation.\nAusterity will also aggravate the weakness of the economy, which is already back in recession.\nThe usual measure of a government's debt burden is the ratio of the debt to GDP.  More borrowing - from the eurozone for the foreseeable future - and weak growth or even continued contraction will mean that debt burden continues rising.\nSo what Greece needs is a period of decent economic growth.  Arithmetically that would help reduce the debt burden, by making it smaller in relation to the country's GDP. More practically it would help bring in more tax revenue that would make the debt more bearable.\nEven on the most optimistic forecasts of economic growth and money coming in from privatising state assets the debt burden will remain high.\nSo inevitably, the question of debt relief will never be far below the surface.\nIt has been a priority for the Greek government led by Alexis Tsipras.\nFirst it is important to be clear that Greece has already had debt relief of a sort - as have Ireland and Portugal. There have been no reductions in the principal, the nominal amount that must ultimately be repaid. But the repayment period for the eurozone loan has been extended and the interest rate cut. There have also been longer \"grace periods\" given before any payment is required.\nThe eurozone summit statement which agreed the launch of new bailout negotiations held out the possibility of even longer grace and repayment periods to ensure that \"financing needs remain at a sustainable level\".  Any such moves would be dependent on full implementation of the policies agreed in the forthcoming negotiations.\nBut the eurozone summit also said that outright reductions in the debt to be repaid - what it called \"nominal haircuts\" - would not be undertaken.\nWhy not? Two likely reasons. One is domestic politics in the creditor countries.  A \"haircut\" converts a loan quite obviously into a partial hand-out.  Cutting the interest rate and extending the repayment period might have the same effect - you would certainly think so if you were a professional investor suffering a loss in what's called \"net present value\" - but it isn't quite so obvious when a government has to tell the taxpayers at home what they have done with their money.\nThe other factor is the desire to retain a carrot to encourage Greece to comply with the lending conditions.  Once you have given a debt 'haircut' it's difficult to reverse. Retaining the ability to vary the repayment terms gives the lenders more scope to lean on Greek governments in the future to do whatever has been agreed.\nFor now however, the focus is on agreeing the detailed policy programme for the third bailout. One important date on the horizon is the next big payment owed to the European Central Bank - that is payment for bonds the ECB bought in the financial markets between 2010 and 2012 which are due for repayment on 20 August.  Greece will need help to find the money - either funds from the third bailout or, if it is not agreed by then, additional short term bridge finance.\nEither way it is a deadline that is likely to generate some further tension, within Greece and between Athens and the rest of the eurozone, as it approaches.\nAnd for the longer term the difficulties ahead are so apparent that many commentators are convinced the issue of 'Grexit' from the eurozone will raise its head again, sooner or later.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I have never seen Iceland react in this way before.\n\"People are hurt and disappointed by Gunnlaugsson - it is not what they voted for.\n\"Even people who are loyal to the government are baffled - they have no words.\n\"One of the reasons why the government got a big following was that they said they'll take a strong hold of the economy.\n\"But the normal Icelander lost everything - their jobs, their homes, their future.\"\n\"I'm not surprised he has resigned. It was obvious this would happen eventually. I'm happy about it.\n\"He did the right thing but it should have been sooner. I hope they call for snap elections now. We won't stop protesting until we get that.\n\"The protests definitely put more pressure on Gunnlaugsson and everyone else in the coalition.\n\"It showed that we as a nation were not going to back down.\n\"There is definitely excitement and changes in the air here in Iceland.\"\n\"The prime minister, the finance minister, and the interior minister have all been named in the Panama Papers.\n\"I feel a mixture of anger, shame and betrayal - it's the same feeling I had during the financial crisis.\n\"Recently, Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and the finance minister talked about the Icelandic Kronur being stable.\n\"But they keep their money elsewhere like they don't trust the system with their own money.\n\"In Iceland our welfare system is horrible - they are trying to privatise the hospitals and healthcare system because there's no money in the budget.\n\"If everyone paid their taxes we would have a good welfare system.\n\"The taxes go up on food but don't raise them for rich people.\n\"There's almost a divide in our country.\"\n\"Like half the nation, I've been watching TV live.

It is purely based on the enormous reaction from the citizens of Iceland in the wake of the Panama television expose and his disregard to the public's reaction.\n\"On Monday you could not see a spot of grass at Austurvollur where the protests took place.  It was hard to wade through the crowds.\n\"Different kinds of people were there from the far left to the far right, from the old and the young - I was there with my children.\n\"The prime minister declined interviews with national TV for the last two weeks but he made an appearance elsewhere and said he hadn't thought of resigning, and that people wouldn't go out to protest in their numbers.\n\"Monday's protest was a blunt message to him. I was already planning to go to the protest but after Sunday's broadcast, I got really angry.\n\"I was flabbergasted after hearing about the Panama Papers, but it didn't surprise me.

{"text": "Hurricane Harvey has produced high winds and extensive flooding forcing thousands of people from their homes.\nThe closures are expected to cause a temporary spike in US gas prices.\nAnalysts expect the economic impact of the storm to hit $40bn (√Ç¬£31bn; 33bn euros), with direct losses of $20bn.\nThe storm's path through southeast Texas and the Gulf of Mexico has hit the heart of the US energy industry, an area home to almost half of US refining capacity and a fifth of its oil production.\nHouston, where water has overwhelmed the streets, is also the base of one of America's largest ports.\nUS gas prices rose around 10% ahead of the storm, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US.\nHe expects prices to jump by another 20-30% over the next two weeks in the Texas region, with less significant increases elsewhere, he said.\nFood prices could also be affected, as shipments of wheat and soybeans are delayed, he added.\nGlobally the impact is likely to be smaller, since the US is not a major source of energy exports and supplies remain historically high.\nAssuming the current weather forecast holds, Mr Brusuelas said he expects US prices to subside, as operations restart over the next two weeks.\nOver the longer term, the havoc wreaked by the storm on businesses and households is likely to reduce energy demand in the US, analysts from Goldman Sachs predicted.\nHouston is the fourth largest city in the US, and produces more than $500bn in economic activity annually.\nUS economic growth could slow by about a tenth of a percentage point in the quarter as a result of the storm, said Mr Brusuelas. The economy should rebound in the following six months, as spending increases on reconstruction and other efforts.\nSo far, oil and gas companies are focused on the immediate emergency and the safety of their personnel, without reports of major damages, said Bruce Jefferis, chief executive of Aon Energy, who is based in Houston.\nAbout 18% of oil and natural gas production in the Gulf has stopped, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.\nAbout 11% of all US refining capacity has also shut down, with others operating at reduced rates according to the most recent update from the US Department of Energy. Goldman Sachs put the figure higher at almost 17%.\nWhile big oil and gas companies are well-prepared for such abnormal weather, Mr Jefferis said the effect on families - many of whom are likely to be uninsured - and smaller businesses is likely to be far more significant.\n\"Truly this is an unprecedented storm for the Texas area,\" he said.\nHurricane Ike is estimated to have caused more than $12bn in insured damage when it hit Texas in 2008, with overall damages as high as $29bn.\nMark Hanna, spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas, said it's clear that damages caused by Harvey are more significant, but he cautioned that numbers for damages that are surfacing now - as rain continues to fall - are premature.\n\"Nobody can put a figure like that on a storm at this moment,\" said Mr Hanna, whose organisation represents about 400 insurance companies.\n\"We know the losses are going to be extensive. When you have a city the size of Houston ... under water, that alone tells you you have a massive problem.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.\nThey made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent.\nSecurity experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking.\nThe web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.\nIn a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords.\nXiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks.\n\"Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,\" it said. \"Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too.\"\nIt has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack.\nThe recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.\nYes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.\nBefore the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.\nFor the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.\nAnd because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.\nNot easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.\nThere is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.\nAlso, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.\nBecause security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.\nDespite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.\nRight now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.\nIn one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "\"It's interesting as one hand, there's something of Trump about the man,\" says the actor, who plays the leading role in the film, The Founder, which examines the beginnings of the fast food empire as a simple Californian drive-in. Parks and Recreation actor Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch play the brothers.\n\"The difference is Donald Trump may have worked hard but he certainly had the enormous advantage of being born wealthy, whereas Ray Kroc was not. But Ray is less than ethical at the end of the movie, and I suppose I could say that in certain ways Donald Trump appears unethical,\" Keaton continues.\n\"Ray Kroc also became this larger than life character at the high point of his wealth, and Trump is unbelievably needy to the point where it's funny - but it's also frightening.\"\nThe Founder is also \"a movie about America and a movie about capitalism\", according to its director, The Blind Side's John Lee Hancock.\n\"It was definitely about capitalism rather than fast food - the rush to make more.\"\nIt's also about what might have been, unwittingly, modern capitalism's first major corporate takeover. Ray Kroc was a 50-something travelling salesman when he met the McDonald brothers, two businessmen who lost their money in the Depression of the 1930s, but who had built up their own California roadside restaurant.\nStruck by the fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging and the family atmosphere, Kroc asks to start franchising the brand, although the brothers are happily committed to their original restaurant and its small workforce.\nEventually, Kroc bought the McDonalds name, the company and even built a branch of McDonalds opposite the brothers' original restaurant, putting them out of business.\nDespite a handshake agreement that the McDonald family was to receive 1 percent of all future profits from the chain, it never occurred. Last year, the company made US $1.31 billion (√Ç¬£1.0 billion) in profits and had stores in 118 countries.\n\"I think it's an interesting take on what the American Dream has become to those watching from outside - that even a million isn't enough,\" Keaton says.  \"That it's not enough to lead a good, comfortable life - that you need a billion dollars to have 'made it'. Ray Kroc basically mechanised capitalism - he wanted a billion dollars.\n\"I always thought that the American Dream, in its simpler form, was 'work hard, have a house, go on vacation.' That's what it was, but it's no longer the perception of it.\n\"Ray Kroc did actually say 'if your competitor is drowning, stick a hose in his mouth.' Now I'm a fan of hard work, there wasn't a time in his life that my Dad didn't have two jobs. I'm not a fan of sadistic greed, but as an actor it's intriguing.\"\nAs the first 'fast food' chain, McDonalds has gone on to have far-reaching impact, \"and not only in the way we eat,\" Keaton argues.\n\"It's changed culture beyond food. It basically became the Henry Ford mechanical production line for food, but it's helped build a portable society, a disposable society, and that's not overblowing it.\n\"Part of the year I live on a ranch, and I'm not even talking about the effect of too many cattle producing methane, it's about overgrazing of the land to produce so much meat. People just don't realise how that affects the environment.\"\nKeaton points out that another hot topic crops up in the film - that of immigration.\n\"Kroc pursued the McDonalds name because he thought it was so American - even though of course, it's Scottish,\" he says. \"His own name was Slavic and he thought of it as less. But it's a reminder that the whole country's an immigrant - I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 50s and it was full of Russians, Poles, Irish and Italians. Trump's an immigrant, basically.\"\nHowever, the 65-year-old actor says he does admire certain things about Kroc. After early success in 1988's Beetlejuice, and playing Batman in 1989, Keaton's career has kickstarted again in his 60s with roles in recent Oscar winners, Birdman and Spotlight.\n\"I admire Kroc's perseverance, hard work, focus and will,\" he says. \"And the guy was 52 when he began this journey, and in those days, that was old. I admire all of that, I just don't admire what came later - the masochistic greed.\n\"It can't have been all about the money, it must have been about power. He stole the whole thing about being 'the founder'. Or possibly maybe he was able to justify it. Maybe he said to himself, 'I am the founder of what this became.' That's a pretty good argument- that the McDonald brothers had a nice idea about serving burgers, but he went so much further.\"\nThe Founder is released in the UK on 17 February\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961.\nBy 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute.\nHe went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941.\nBy the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy.\nHaving bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators.\nHe also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking.\nThe Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack.\nStigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy.\nBut he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd.\n\"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. Audiences took note, and the film flopped at the box office, although the soundtrack sold well.\nStigwood went on to produce the similarly-disappointing sequels Grease 2 and Staying Alive - but found success later in life with the Madonna-starring musical Evita, which won the 1997 Golden Globe for best film.\nThe movie's lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, paid tribute to Stigwood on Twitter, calling him \"extraordinary, innovative [and] generous\".\n\"[He was] a vital part of my life,\" he added.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nEven fewer could have imagined just how the game would ebb and flow, and ultimately provide Aberdeen with their first chance in 17 years to win a cup they treated as their own in the eighties.\nIn 1990, as Alex McLeish lifted the trophy just as Willie Miller had done four times in the preceding decade, it would have seemed inconceivable they would not do so again.\nBut those are the bare facts. And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.\nAnd yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.\nTheir desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.\nBut it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.\nThe ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.\nThe introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.\nAgain his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.\nThat equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.\nThe Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.\nBut Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.\nMcInnes's assertion that they were deserved winners is a generous one, but they stuck steadfastly to their task and though Jonny Hayes' winner had a huge slice of luck attached to it, Aberdeen now have the opportunity to make amends for a tame League Cup final showing earlier in the season.\nAfter the match, Lennon declined to accept the tag of gallant losers, insisting his team were simply losers.\nIt's a harsh assessment but an indication of the standards the Hibs manager demands - and will continue to demand - from his side.\nLennon has not amassed the medals he has won as a player and manager by accepting second-best, which is what his side were by some distance in the opening half-hour.\nBut he can take solace - on reflection - in the manner his team dug in to give the country's second-best team quite a fright.\nHe can now turn his attention fully to building for next season's return to the Premiership. A few astute signings could ensure they are challenging in the upper half of the table this time next year.\nFor Derek McInnes, though, the short-term requires his full attention. Second place in the Premiership looks a safe bet, though not yet an absolute certainty.\nBut he and his players could make a real name for themselves back at Hampden on 27 May if they can end the 27-year wait to reclaim the Scottish Cup.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "The former astronaut cheered as the United States won the women's gymnastics team title on Tuesday and saluted the special quintet, one of whom was the extraordinary Simone Biles.\nBiles, the innovator, the ground-breaker, is a gymnast who comes along every other generation or so - a 19-year-old hailed as the most talented anyone has seen. She is already a superstar of her sport and, by the time the Olympic flame is extinguished, is likely to orbit the same space as the planet's most recognisable stars.\nThis 4ft 8in gymnast from Texas, placed into foster care because of her mother's struggles with drugs and alcohol and adopted when she was five by her maternal grandfather and his wife, has already won two Olympic golds at her debut Games.\nShe could win five. She is expected to win five. She is almost untouchable.\nIt is the end of June, at the American national championships in St Louis, and the Olympics are fewer than two months away.\nBiles is in the middle of her floor routine. Watching on is 2008 Olympic all-around silver medallist Shawn Johnson. The reigning champion spots Johnson in the crowd, cheekily winks at her and flashes a smile, before continuing to perform vertigo-inducing somersaults.\nNo-one else would have the chutzpah. No-one else looks like they're having so much fun.\nThe athlete herself says it is her ability to enjoy the spotlight which sets her apart. \"It's how it works best for me and how I get success out there,\" she says.\nBut cheer and calmness are not the only attributes that separate the ebullient American from the rest. It has been three years since Biles, her sport's first black female world champion, entered an all-around competition and did not win.\nNo female gymnast has ever had her power, reached such soaring heights, been so consistent and performed jaw-dropping routines with such joy. \"I would make the case that she's the best athlete in Rio,\" says ESPN's TJ Quinn.\nThe differences between the three-time world champion and the others are not subtle. She is faster, stronger - her powerful run allows the teenager to include more elements in her routine than competitors who have to go further before they can start tumbling.\nOn the floor, the girl described as having legs made by Nasa can leap a foot or two higher than her rivals. Her coach Aimee Boorman has said her pupil has exceptional \"air sense\", the innate ability to know where she is in mid-air.\nBiles is also bolder and more consistent, too. Small and light, her compact body is also perfect for her sport.\n\"She's certainly doing the most difficult work we've ever seen,\" says Christine Still, a gymnastics coach and member of BBC Sport's commentary team. \"In terms of performance and her ability to perform again and again, she's the best I've ever seen.\"\nAs a child, Biles would watch older girls and copy them with ease. According to her coach, she will learn a new skill in three days, while most gymnasts take months or years to master a move.\nQuinn asks: \"How many sports can she enter? I wouldn't be surprised if she could dunk a basketball.\"\nAt this year's Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships, Biles decided to skip the second day of competition and watched on from a hospitality box, but a group of young girls saw their diminutive hero. Biles, forced to think as adroitly as she usually moves, had to call security to stop the fans from climbing into the suite.\nIn March, Biles admitted on The Ellen DeGeneres Show she had a crush on Hollywood actor Zac Efron. If the pair were to meet - they have been tweeting each other - they could discuss tales of a life lived with devoted fans.\nIf more evidence of her celebrity on home soil was needed, NBC's footage of that St Louis routine - where Biles winked at Johnson - was reportedly viewed more than 11 million times on the internet in just the first few days.\nAnd it is no surprise to learn that the girl with the megawatt smile is the most searched female gymnast on Google and has her own emojis, with an app launched before the Olympics called Simoji.\nHer profile is increasing around the world, too. During Tuesday's team final, the five countries where her name was Googled most were USA, Republic of Ireland, Canada, Spain and New Zealand.\nFollowing her magnificent all-around performance on Thursday, she was trending on Twitter - generating two-and-a-half times more tweets than anything, or anyone, else at the time.\n\"Most Americans love her and why not?\" says Louis Moore, associate professor of African American, sports and gender history at Grand Valley State University. \"She's successful, amazing to watch, and her success helps push narratives about hard work and democracy. She's primetime TV.\n\"Given her background and sport, there's not another athlete like her historically. There's been anticipation for this moment for quite some time.\"\nBiles flips and spins on the four-inch-wide balance beam as if she were on a pavement. On the vault, she does the Amanar - one of the hardest moves performed by women - and no-one can match her height, execution and consistency.\nBut it is on the floor where she truly astonishes, dazzling spectators with 'The Biles' - her signature move - which is incorporated into the hardest floor routine in history.\nAlmost as exhausting to describe as it is to perform, it is a double backward somersault with the body fully extended, followed by a half-twist and a blind landing. At the peak of the move, she clears nearly twice her height, the equivalent of tumbling over a football goalpost.\nUntil Biles did so in 2013, no-one had ever tried the move in competition.\n\"I love it,\" says Beth Tweddle, the British London 2012 uneven bars bronze medallist. \"She's got that personality, she really showcases gymnastics.\"\n'Just give Simone Biles the Gold Medal' was a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal as the American newspaper described her as the \"heaviest favourite in the entire Olympics\" for all-around gold.\nThere was logic behind the bombast - and they were proved right as she sparkled on the grandest stage on Thursday to become only the second woman in history to hold both the world and Olympic all-around titles.\nBiles performs routines which are so much more difficult than her rivals that others would have to be near flawless and hope for Biles to falter badly to have a chance of catching her. That has yet to happen in Rio.\nThis special talent - called \"a once-in-a-thousand-year athlete\" by William Sands, a former research director for USA Gymnastics - is capable of more.\nTraining videos show Biles pulling off gravity-defying tricks on a different level to what is seen from her in competition. \"She's obviously competing at a level below what she's training,\" says Tweddle. \"She makes it look very easy.\"\nFormer 200m and 400m Olympic champion Michael Johnson once said Usain Bolt could run quicker were he to strengthen his core muscles. The Jamaican hasn't heeded Johnson's advice because he doesn't have to - he is already the fastest man in history.\nThe same applies to Biles - why attempt trickier routines in public when she is already better than the rest by some distance?\nFour years ago, Biles' fellow American Gabby Douglas arrived in London with no sponsorship - only after becoming the first black woman to win all-around Olympic gold did big businesses chase her.\nBiles, owner of more World Championships gold medals than any female gymnast in history, already has a champion's portfolio with 'wholesome brands' such as Nike, Kellogg's and United Airlines firm in their belief that Olympic greatness is a foregone conclusion.\nRick Horrow, visiting sports business expert at Harvard law school, says Biles has the \"It factor\".\n\"She has the charisma, the appearance of humility, the looks, the radiance when interviewed to build on that capital,\" he says.\nHer current earnings of $2m (¬£1.5m) a year, he says, could be a \"scratch in the bucket\" if she wins five gold medals in Rio and becomes a familiar face outside the gymnastics world - appearing regularly on TV and corporate events. \"The kinds of things that celebrities do beyond the sport itself,\" adds Harrow.\nShe is not yet a Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, but she has strong foundations from which to build.\n\"She's the best I've ever seen,\" says 1984 Olympic all-around champion Mary Lou Retton, while 2008 all-around champion Nastia Liukin is equally lavish in her praise, describing her as \"the best gymnast that has ever lived\".\nBut there is more to Biles than gymnastic genius. \"Her story is incredibly compelling,\" says Quinn.\nShe was adopted by grandfather Ron, an air traffic controller, and his wife Nellie, a former nurse, as her birth-mother, dependent on drugs and alcohol, was unable to care for her eight children.\nThe girl who accidentally stumbled upon gymnastics when on a field trip as a six-year-old is also a member of the most racially and ethnically diverse group of Olympic gymnasts in the American team's history.\n\"They are demonstrating there really are no racial boundaries from the standpoint of participation in our sport,\" said USA gymnastics president Steve Penny.\nOf the five women representing the United States, Douglas and Biles are black, Laurie Hernandez is Hispanic with Puerto Rican heritage and Madison Kocian and Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, are both white.\nBiles is not the first black American gymnast to compete at the Olympics and she is not the first black woman to win the Olympic all-round gold - her team-mate Douglas did so in 2012.\nBut US President Barack Obama has spoken this year of his country's deepening sense of alienation and anger, so will Biles' Olympic achievements positively impact an America which is politically and racially divided?\n\"African Americans, especially young girls, get an opportunity to see themselves in Biles; not so much winning a gold medal, but the adulation and cheers that come with it,\" says Professor Moore.\n\"In this society, we don't do a great job of celebrating black women the way we should.\n\"African Americans also get an opportunity to see a black person succeed in a space that has traditionally been seen as off limits - but we're in the midst of a Black Lives Matter movement for a reason.\n\"Most African Americans are still fighting for equality, better schools, equal pay, access to jobs - and also an end to abuse from police and the criminal justice system.\n\"Her success should be celebrated, it's a great story, but we also have to remember that Biles' success won't change the problems most African Americans still face.\n\"In the end, however, I think her success will inspire others to dream - and everyone will remember this as the Olympics they saw Simone Biles.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

It has no political capital to waste.\"\nBut however damaging the knighthood proves to be, commentators say it is unlikely by itself to be Mr Abbott's downfall.\n\"An MP from the conservative right of the party in Mr Abbott's home state predicted it would spark fresh questioning of the Prime Minister's suitability for the job,\" says an editorial in The Age. \"A change seems unlikely but it is the cumulative risk of errors.\"\nA commentator in the Australian Financial Review says Mr Abbott has antagonised the opposition as well as his own base in the Liberal party by giving the award to Prince Philip.\n\"It is more the act of a mischievous student politician who wants to aggravate the left as part of a campus brawl,\" the commentator said.\n\"No one is talking mutiny but the prime minister needs to be careful.

{"text": "Scotland's ancient universities elect rectors to chair their governing bodies and champion students' interests.\nSpeaking at his inauguration, TV executive Steve Morrison said the new Higher Education Governance Bill could lead to their removal.\nThe Scottish government said it had no plans to abolish the role of rector.\nThe position of rector is an ancient one and in many respects often ceremonial. The rector of Edinburgh University presides over the institution's governing body.\nInevitably, some rectors play a largely symbolic role - in 2014 students at Glasgow University elected whistleblower Edward Snowdon who is currently claiming asylum in Russia - and on occasions, celebrities and public figures have been elected.\nOther rectors, however, are in a position to try to be proactive champions of the students' interests.\nRectors are elected at the four ancient universities - Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and Aberdeen - and also at Dundee. The University of the Highlands and Islands has a rector although the role there is different .\nIn his inauguration speech, Mr Morrison said he believed other Scottish higher education institutions should follow Edinburgh's example and warned proposed changes to the way universities are governed could end the role of the rector..\nOne proposal in the bill is to directly elect the chairs of each university's governing body, but some critics claim these elections could involve people other than students and staff.\nMr Morrison said: \"Every student and every member of staff, academic and non-academic, has the right to vote for the rector who presides over the governing body of the university - that is our inclusive Edinburgh model.\n\"I respectfully propose that every Scottish higher education institution should follow this example when electing the chair.\"\nThe Scottish government insisted it did not intent to abolish the position of rector at universities. A spokesman said: \"The Scottish government recognises the contribution made by rectors.  Over the summer, we have been talking to all higher education stakeholders, including current rectors, about their views on how a model for elected chairs of court might work in practice.\n\"As the Higher Education Bill progresses through parliament, we will continue to listen to all constructive views and suggestions made.\"\nThe Higher Education Governance (Scotland) Bill would require governing bodies to include at least two members directly elected by staff, and two members each nominated by trade unions, students' unions and alumni associations.\nThe proposal that the chairs of the governing bodies be chosen through an election has proved controversial and led to claims that it could involve voters from outside the university.\nCritics have also argued that trade union representatives could be torn between the interests of their members and the interests of the institution.\nAs well as a rector, Edinburgh University also has a vice convener who chairs several of the university's most important committees and helps hold the Principal to account.\nMr Morrison is a graduate of Edinburgh University and was the first student to run to become rector in the 1960s.\nHe later became the director of programmes and then chief executive of Granada Television. He left to found All3Media, Britain's largest independent television production group, and is still the company's non-executive chairman.\nAt his inauguration, attended by the Chancellor of the University, Princess Anne, Mr Morrison also called on students to use their time at university to equip themselves with the skills that will be required in the changing world of the digital economy.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "In China, Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence program took on and beat the world champion of the complex game of Go, reducing him to tears. Nineteen-year-old Ke Jie described the AI computer as \"perfect, flawless, without any emotions\".\nBut in airports in the UK and elsewhere last weekend tears were also being shed over computers.\nIn this case, though, the primary emotions were frustration and rage over the chaos caused when British Airways' IT system collapsed, leaving thousands of passengers going nowhere and their baggage stuck they knew not where.\nWhat is striking about both these cases is how difficult human beings found it to explain exactly what was happening inside the brains of the computers.\nDeepMind's AlphaGo is largely self-taught - it was shown the basic rules of Go and then it spent time looking at millions of games and playing against itself, coming up with moves that astounded professional players and its creators.\nBA's computers were not so smart. The company says its problems began when there was a power surge at a data centre at Heathrow Airport in London.\nThat shouldn't have been more than a temporary hitch - in fact one expert told me it should not have even set the lights blinking at the data centre - but it seems to have triggered a chain reaction which took out the entire system.\nThat meant the sea of complex data about passengers, baggage and aircraft movements was effectively frozen - and it took 48 hours to unfreeze it and get the airline working again.\nAny major organisation is likely to have both a backup system to switch to when things go wrong and a disaster recovery plan, which should be rehearsed on a regular basis. But in British Airways' case neither appears to have worked as it should.\nThe trade unions blame cost-cutting and the fact that BA outsourced much of its IT operation to India last year.\nThe bosses deny that and say they are now clear what went wrong - but so far, have been unable to give an explanation that seems satisfactory to people with expertise in how data centres and major IT operations work.\nBut what is clear is that ever more areas of our lives are dependent on vast computer systems, often now hosted in data centres owned by companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\nThese systems have become essential to industries from banking to travel to healthcare and they are helping them become more efficient - sometimes by getting much of the work done in countries like India where costs are lower.\nThey are also making life better in all sorts of ways - just think of how time-consuming it used to be to book a flight or apply for a place at university and how much paper was involved.\nBut now we are beginning to find out just how helpless we feel when, for whatever reason, the computers fail.\nIn Britain, doctors whose computers froze during the recent ransomware attack had to turn patients away. In Ukraine, there were power cuts when hackers attacked the electricity system, and five years ago, millions of Royal Bank of Scotland customers were unable to get at their money for days after problems with a software upgrade.\nAlready some people have had enough. This week a letter to the Guardian newspaper warned that the modern world was \"dangerously exposed by this reliance on the internet and new technology\".\nThe correspondent, quite possibly a retired government employee, continued \"there are just enough old-time civil servants left alive to turn back the clock and take away our dangerous dependence on modern technology.\"\nSomehow, though, I don't see this happening. Airlines are not going to scrap the computers and tick passengers off on a paper list before they climb aboard, bank clerks will not be entering transactions in giant ledgers in copperplate writing.\nIn fact, computers will take over more and more functions once restricted to humans, most of them far more useful than a game of Go. And that means that at home, at work and at play we will have to get used to seeing our lives disrupted when those clever machines suffer the occasional nervous breakdown.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Due to her poor credit rating, she will not be able to get a mortgage - or rent a private flat - for at least six years.\nA recent report for the TUC and the charity Women's Aid  - called Unequal Trapped and Controlled - found that financial abuse was often the first sign of further emotional or domestic abuse.\nThe authors of that report, Marilyn Howard and Amy Skipp, say the ten most frequent signs to look out for are a partner who:\nUnder the Serious Crime Act - which has received royal assent, and which will be implemented later this year - coercive and controlling behaviour between partners will become illegal for the first time.\nSection 76 of the Act allows for a maximum prison sentence of five years, where someone's behaviour causes alarm or serious distress to their partner. This can include financial abuse.\nAs a result, the Police will be given training in how to spot instances of coercive control.\nPolly Neate, the chief executive of Women's Aid, believes the law will encourage victims to come forward.\n\"We know of many cases where women have not come forward about controlling coercive abuse - including financial abuse - because they feel the Police won't take any action unless they've been physically assaulted.\nWe're hoping this new law will change that,\" she says.\nBut there is widespread concern about another development - the roll-out of Universal Credit (UC).\nThe benefit is paid monthly on a household basis. The TUC report warns that UC will make it easier for one partner to control the finances.\nEven though the DWP has promised to make split payments where necessary, Polly Neate thinks many victims will still acquiesce.\n\"Universal Credit, as currently planned, is another tool for people who want to financially abuse their partner,\" she claims.\nMoney Advice Service 0300 500 5000\nNational Domestic Violence Helpline 0808 2000 247\nFor Jane - as for many couples - having a joint account was a particular difficulty.

Consumption data paints a similar picture, while figures for this year are set to tell the same story.\nThere are a number of drivers behind coal's renaissance, many of which may be short lived. Others will push demand ever higher for decades to come.\nCoal consumption in Europe, where governments have been at the forefront of the push to curb carbon dioxide emissions, has risen sharply in recent years.\nWhy? Because it's cheap, and getting cheaper all the time. Due to the economic downturn, there has been what Paul McConnell, senior analyst at energy research group Wood Mackenzie, calls a \"collapse in industrial demand for energy\". This has led to an oversupply of coal, pushing the price down.\nIt has also led to a massive surfeit of CO2 emissions permits, pushing the price of carbon, and therefore the cost of coal production, sharply lower.\nEqually important, there has been a huge influx of cheap coal from the US, where the discovery of shale gas has provided an even cheaper alternative energy source. The coal has to go somewhere, so it's exported to Europe.\nFinally, higher non-shale, natural gas prices are making coal an attractive alternative.\nAs Laszlo Varro, head of gas, coal and power markets at the International Energy Agency (IEA), says: \"All parameters favour coal.\"\nSo much so that \"coal is [now] being burned as the baseload fuel across most of Europe,\" says Gareth Carpenter, associate editor at global energy information provider Platts.\nGermany's decision to scrap all nuclear power and build more coal-fired power stations can only boost production further.\nJust how long coal's resurgence lasts depends to some extent on the global economic recovery and the ability of governments to implement a system that finally delivers a meaningful carbon price.\nBut, in the meantime, legislation passed more than a decade ago will severely curb coal production over the coming years, according to Mr Varro.\nThe full impact of the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, which is designed to reduce local air pollutants, but not in fact carbon dioxide, is about to be felt, meaning a number of inefficient coal plants will be decommissioned.\nAs a result, in five years, coal production capacity \"will be considerably lower than today\", says Mr Varro. The directive will do nothing, of course, to restrict cheap US imports.\nBut whatever happens to coal production and consumption in Europe, spiralling demand for energy in Asia, in particular China, will ensure that coal production continues to rise significantly over the coming decades.\nSource: BP. Reserves calculated at current price using current technologies\nPopulation growth and the exploding middle classes will see to that - in China alone, demand for energy will triple by 2030, according to Wood Mackenzie.\nChina in particular is spending massive amounts of money on a renewable energy drive the likes of which the world has never seen - plans are in place to build almost 10 times the wind capacity of Germany, for example.\nBut even this will not be able to keep up with demand, meaning fossil fuels will continue to make up the majority of the overall energy mix for the foreseeable future.\nAnd when it comes to fossil fuels, coal is the easy winner - it is generally easier and cheaper to mine, and easier to transport using existing infrastructure such as roads and rail, than oil or gas.\nIts price is also relatively stable because, as Mr Carpenter points out: \"Coal mines on the whole are located in relatively stable countries free from major geopolitical tensions.\"\nFor all these reasons, Wood Mackenzie forecasts coal production in Indonesia, currently the world's fourth-biggest coal producer, to rise by 60% by 2020, while China will import more than a billion tonnes by 2030, almost five times currents levels.\nBy this date, it expects global demand for imported coal to more than double, helping to push the fossil fuel's proportion of the overall energy mix even higher than it is today.\nCheap energy is, of course, a vital ingredient in the continued economic growth of developing countries, but the implications of rising coal production for CO2 emissions and global warming are profound.\nWhile China is currently running half a dozen carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects - which aim to capture CO2 emissions from coal plants and bury it underground - the technology is nowhere near commercial viability.\nAs Mr Carpenter says, despite all the hype \"it looks extremely unlikely that CCS technology is going to be deployed widely in the next 10 years or so\".\nThe inevitable end result is rising CO2 emissions. According to the IEA, emissions from fossil fuels hit a record level last year, while total energy-related emissions and are due to rise by more than 20% by 2035.\n\"Why we aren't developing CCS for all we're worth is a mystery to me,\" says Prof Myles Allen at the school of geography and the environment at the University of Oxford.\n\"It is viewed as just one of a basket of solutions, but it's not - it's pivotal. Without it, nothing else follows.\"\nAnd CCS lends itself perfectly to coal, precisely because it is such a cheap energy source.\nRenewed urgency in developing CCS globally, alongside greater strides in increasing renewable energy capacity, is desperately needed, but Europe's increasing reliance on coal without capturing emissions is undermining its status as a leader in clean energy, and therefore global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Refugees are at least relatively safe - unless they are lured onto boats by criminals.\"\nThe refugees who flee to safety abroad also have extra legal protection because of the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention which sets out their basic rights.\nThose left inside Syria, on the other hand, are still formally under the protection of the Bashar al-Assad government, and for many it is his regime which has been the source of their misery.\nOthers will have been forced to flee their homes by Islamic State militants, like the 11,000 people recently chased out of Palmyra in May.\nExperts describe the day-to-day existence of these internal refugees as being like a hidden purgatory.\nMany will be living in makeshift mass shelters. They may not have access to basic amenities like clean water or electricity.\nAs for medical care, that too will be patchy - the World Health Organization estimates that 57% of Syria's hospitals are now out of action.\nYet helping those left in Syria remains the trickiest task of all facing the world's leaders.\n\"I think we use up a lot of energy talking about solving the refugee crisis, but far less focus on finding a solution to the conflict itself,\" says Mr Hansen.\n\"We need to find a way of stopping the fighting.\"\nFor those who have followed the horrors of the Syrian conflict since it began, it makes no sense to only help those who have escaped abroad because - like the Kurdi family - today's \"internally displaced person\" will be tomorrow's refugee.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

Mr Le Drian is regarded as quiet but effective.\nNicolas Hulot, ecology minister: An environmentalist opposed to nuclear energy, he was heavily involved in the COP21 climate change conference in Paris. In some ways his appointment was a surprise as he has in the past criticised Mr Macron for seeing green policies as an afterthought to free trade.\nSylvie Goulard, defence minister: At 52, she is a Euro-MP and has been part of Mr Macron's foreign affairs team for several months.

Another figure from civil society, Sophie Cluzel, is given the role of disabilities minister. Her four children include a daughter with Down's Syndrome.\nLaura Flessel, sports minister: Aged 45, she is a double Olympic fencing champion widely known in French sport. With an eye to the Paris bid to hold the 2024 Olympics, Mr Macron has deliberately chosen one of its chief supporters.\nFran√ßoise Nyssen, culture minister: Born in Belgium, she worked for the Belgian government for several years in urban planning before moving into publishing in France.\nMurielle P√©nicaud, labour minister: No stranger to the labour ministry, where she worked in the early 1990s, Ms P√©nicaud, 61, has been head of the Business France agency with the aim of attracting foreign investment.\nTwo members of the new cabinet were an integral part of the Macron presidential campaign team.\nRichard Ferrand, minister for territorial cohesion: Aged 54, he is also secretary general of Mr Macron's fledgling La R√©publique en Marche (Republic on the move) party.\nMounir Mahjoubi, junior minister for digital affairs: He ran the digital side of Mr Macron's presidential campaign but now has a high-profile post in government.

After his death, it was revealed his Facebook profile - created under the name \"Kim Chol\" - said his favourite musicians were French singer Serge Gainsbourg and Japanese singer Hiroshi Itsuki.\nKim Jong-nam never ended up in a political prison, but after his fall from favour in 2001, it is thought he relocated to Macau, where he is said to have enjoyed the slot machines, although other reports suggested he might be living in Singapore.\nAfter a few years away from his family's power base, he began to openly criticise North Korea. He was quoted by Japanese media in 2010 as saying he opposed ''dynastic succession''.\nFollowing his father's death in December 2011, he appears to have become bolder. Kim's comments about his younger brother's ability to maintain \"absolute power\" to a Japanese journalist singled him out as his highest-profile critic.\nKim told Yoji Gomi the country would collapse without reform, but reform would lead to the collapse of the Kim dynasty, while noting his brother would be little more than a puppet figure, used by the ruling elite.\nWhether or not Kim was ever actually in line for succession is unclear. But his son, Kim Han-sol, who was born in Pyongyang in 1995 and never met his grandfather, suggested Jong-nam was not interested in the role anyway.\n\"My dad was definitely not really interested in politics,\" the teenager told former UN Under-Secretary General Elisabeth Rehn in an interview on Finnish television in 2012.\nDespite this, Jong-nam appeared to remain a target.\nIn 2012, a North Korean spy admitted he had been ordered by the secretive state to attack him.\nHe reportedly went as far as hiring a taxi driver to run Mr Kim over in 2010, but the plot went no further, a court heard.\nThe whereabouts of Kim Jong-chul, Kim Jong-il's middle son, apparently passed over for succession for being too effeminate, is not known.\nHe was last spotted at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

But he clung to his position that the niqab threatened the fabric of Canadian society.\n\"Most Canadians believe that it is offensive that someone would hide their identify at the very moment where they are committing to join the Canadian family,\" was how he put it.\nMr Trudeau on the other hand argued: \"It's obvious that he's playing very reckless and dangerous games, pitting Canadians against one another for a narrow political goal.\"\nMr Trudeau also took the view that Canada should withdraw its fighter jets from the bombing campaign against the so-called Islamic State.\nBut in a deft touch that showed he is no pacifist he promised to commit more troops to training up Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces to fight the jihadists while calling time on Canada's commitment to the aerial war.\nOn Iran, where the Harper government had cold-shouldered the nuclear deal and reaffirmed its support for Israel, Mr Trudeau again took a nuanced position, welcoming a \"significant agreement\" and affirming \"the importance of a diplomatic solution while ensuring Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon.\"\nOn every major Middle East issue Mr Trudeau offered a fresh take. Mr Harper with his unquestioning support for Netanyahu and his deep suspicion of Iran and much of the Arab world brought nothing new to the table. Having staked out his position, he proved incapable of moving from it, a fatal flaw with an electorate hungry for change.\nIndeed it is no small irony that while in the televised leaders' debates the Middle East received scant attention, on the campaign trail it may well have proven to be Stephen Harper's Achilles heel.\nNow, with the rout of the Conservatives still fresh, the most pressing issue and the one that Mr Trudeau can act quickly on is the refugee crisis.\nHow Canada's new prime minister responds will be a clear indication of just how significant a Middle East policy realignment his government is prepared to undertake.\nBill Law is a Middle East analyst and a specialist in Gulf affairs.

{"text": "And in recent years Barcelona, inspired by the brilliant Lionel Messi, managed to achieve untouchable status on the pitch at the same time as remaining true to that motto.\nIf somebody thinks that there is damage to the name of Barcelona then there is damage to be repaired\nBut things are changing at the Nou Camp. Not only has the team's form suffered since Pep Guardiola left at the end of 2012, there are now serious questions over the way this great club do business.\nWhen forward Neymar joined from the Brazilian team Santos last June, Barcelona said they paid a total of ¬£48.6m.\nBut one of their members, a pharmacist called Jordi Cases, asked the club whether this was really the final bill. When Barcelona refused to answer, he went to the Spanish courts who launched an investigation.\nFrom that point on the story really began to unravel. First the Spanish prosecutor said they would investigate the deal to see if the club had defrauded the treasury of unpaid tax.\nThe club said they had nothing to hide but then in January, under intense public pressure, the club's president Sandro Rosell resigned.\nHe said it was for personal reasons but Rosell had personally overseen the mission to land the 22-year-old, one of the hottest properties in world football.\nShortly after Rosell's departure, his successor Josep Maria Bartomeu, called a news conference to reveal the true cost of signing Neymar was actually ¬£71.5m.\nBetween the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club ¬£106.8m\nIn an unprecedented move, Bartomeu - a close ally and friend of Rosell who was vice president at the time of the signing - went further, explaining exactly where all the money had gone.\nThere was a ¬£33m compensation fee paid to Neymar's father to ensure he joined Barcelona.\nSantos got ¬£14m.\nBut there was also an ¬£8m signing-on fee, a ¬£6m fee for taking an option on future Santos players, ¬£2m in agents fees (also paid to Neymar's father) and a further ¬£2m to Neymar's charitable foundation in Brazil.\nThe club also revealed that Neymar was being paid ¬£9m a year in wages.\nThe numbers are mind boggling.\nAnd I can't recall a major European club ever opening the books on a transfer in this way. It provides a fascinating insight into the sort of agreements and payments teams have to make to secure the top players - especially from South America where many stars are owned by companies and wealthy individuals rather than clubs.\nBy unwrapping the deal in public, Barcelona hoped that the problem and the Spanish courts would go away.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf anything it only added to their determination to investigate the transfer and two weeks ago the judge Pablo Ruz announced the case would go ahead.\nThat prompted Barcelona to pay ¬£11m to the Spanish treasury as a \"complimentary tax declaration\".\nAnd yet the problem just won't go away with Barcelona still facing the very real possibility of having to explain themselves in court. The lawyer for Jordi Cases has told the BBC he believes the case will still go ahead.\nIt's a real mess and one that has undoubtedly hurt the club's image.\nNo wonder they are on an international charm offensive and on Monday I asked Bartomeu how he and his board can begin to restore Barcelona's reputation.\n\"It's our obligation to explain to everybody that we did everything in the proper way,\" he said.\nBorn: 5 February 1992, Brazil\nBrazil caps: 47\nBrazil goals: 30\nBarcelona apps: 20\nBarcelona goals: 7\nDid you know? Over 14,000 Brazil fans signed a petition unsuccessfully demanding that Neymar be called up for the 2010 World Cup finals after he was not named in then head coach Dunga's squad.\n\"If somebody thinks that there is damage to the name of Barcelona then there is damage to be repaired.\n\"It's embarrassing because we think we are right. We are not happy with the situation but we will defend our club very strongly when the judge will call us to declare.\"\nBartomeu claims the dispute boils down to a disagreement over who is responsible for some of the tax on the various agreements and contracts. Should it be paid by Neymar's father in Brazil, or in Spain because those payments constitute part of the contract with the player?\nSo why pay the Spanish treasury ¬£11m now?\nBartomeu continued: \"We paid because of prudence and because there is a possible different interpretation. For us this is an absurd situation and an unfair situation.\"\nI asked him whether the emergence of clubs like Manchester City and Paris St-Germain, which are owned by super rich benefactors, was making it harder for a club like Barcelona to compete?\n\"It's  more difficult - in the last few years some clubs appear that are owned by one person that sometimes have unlimited sources and at Barca we don't have unlimited sources.\n\"Of course we are a very big club. We are the biggest club in the world but when we compete with unlimited sources we have to find other ways, other strategies.\"\nThe timing of all this couldn't be worse.\nThe team are misfiring. They lost against Real Valladolid on Saturday and are now four points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid, with 11 games to go.\nHolding a 2-0 first-leg advantage over Manchester City, Barcelona should reach the quarter finals of the Champions League on Wednesday, but with Messi struggling with injuries and the new coach Gerardo Martino struggling to find the best way of combining the Argentine with Neymar, pessimism has replaced buoyant confidence.\nForm, as they say, is temporary while class is supposed to be permanent and the far greater challenge for Barcelona is to show that the furore over the Neymar deal is not part of a general slide in values.\nNext month the club's 164,000 members will be asked to vote on whether the Nou Camp should be expanded and modernised as part of a ¬£500m project, which would include the increase in capacity from 99,000 to 105,000.\nTo help pay for the redevelopment, Bartomeu and his board are proposing to sell naming rights to the sacred Nou Camp where there is a feeling that in order to compete with the rest of Europe's super rich clubs they need to be more commercially driven, despite taking in more than ¬£400m a year in revenues.\nThe risk for a club so proud of its democratic ownership model is that the increasing commercialisation will jeopardise its core principles. Put simply, there is a danger they could sell their soul.\nWhile they might have been forced to go public on the Neymar deal, the very fact they set out the full details tells you their image and integrity still matter to the people in charge of Barcelona.\nBut they also know that the Barca brand has been damaged and that they need to work hard to restore the club's glittering reputation.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

I'm delighted for the players who have had long careers and at times there have been difficult moments in those careers. Their loyalty alone has been rewarded by reaching Euro 2016.\nMy message to the players is this is an experience we all have to enjoy. We don't want to come away with regrets.

{"text": "As Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus has pointed out, the rules are the rules, and they aren't a secret.\nBut Mr Trump is right that there are forces coalescing to stop him. And as of Sunday night - with the announcement that presidential candidates John Kasich and Ted Cruz are co-ordinating their efforts in upcoming state primaries - those forces aren't so silent anymore.\nNeither Mr Cruz nor Mr Kasich can win the 1,237 delegates necessary to secure the Republican nomination for themselves. Their only hope is to deny Donald Trump that opportunity as well. And now, at last, their campaigns are publicly acknowledging that they need each other's help to do so.\nAs the two campaigns explained in dual press releases, Mr Cruz will focus on Indiana on 3 May, while Mr Kasich will be given free rein to challenge Mr Trump head-on in the Oregon and New Mexico contests over the following weeks.\nThis announcement comes just days before Mr Cruz and Mr Kasich are likely to receive a thorough drubbing in a handful of states in the mid-Atlantic, including delegate-rich Pennsylvania.\nBy Wednesday morning Mr Trump could have put considerably more distance between himself and his two opponents. So this accord may be an early effort to push the focus past the next round of voting and on to more friendly contests.\nIndiana, one of the last big prizes of the primary season, is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground. A recent poll shows Mr Trump with a comfortable lead in a three-way race that narrows considerably if Mr Kasich is taken out of the equation.\nGiven the rules in Indiana - 30 delegates to the candidate who wins a statewide plurality and three delegates to the top finisher in each of the state's nine congressional districts - every bit of help Mr Cruz can get to edge past Mr Trump will be invaluable.\nIndependent groups backing the #NeverTrump efforts are pouring resources into the state in the hopes that a massive advertising blitz will dent the New York mogul's image. It worked for them in Wisconsin two weeks ago, although those efforts also benefited from a state Republican Party unified in opposing Mr Trump and a conservative media that had been relentlessly bashing him for months.\nThe atmosphere in Indiana is much more muddled. Republican Governor Mike Pence is not endorsing any candidate, and the local talk radio hosts aren't as virulently anti-Trump.\nThis unite-to-defeat-Trump strategy has been kicked around for months, of course. When Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ended his presidential bid last September, he urged his opponents to follow his lead and \"clear the field\" for a candidate with a \"positive, conservative message\" - ie not Mr Trump.\nThe Wisconsin Cassandra was universally ignored.\nIn early March, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called for exactly such an accord between non-Trump candidates, with each focusing on states where they could win and voters acting accordingly.\nShortly before his Florida primary flameout, Senator Marco Rubio's campaign announced it was ceding Ohio to Mr Kasich, perhaps hoping that the Ohio governor would return the favour in Mr Rubio's home state. Mr Kasich's team met the offer with mockery.\nTimes have changed. Now the Kasich campaign is more than willing to play the divide-and-conquer game. The problem, however, is that it would've been much more effective back in March, when Mr Trump was building his lead thanks to plurality wins over a fractured field. And one thing the two campaigns aren't doing is urging their supporters to actually vote for their counterpart.\nThe result is more a cessation of hostilities than a full-fledged joint effort. In addition, the agreement doesn't extend to the eight other primaries on the calendar in May and June.\nPerhaps this is just a first step toward such full co-ordination. Or perhaps it's a bridge the two campaigns will never cross, dire straits or no.\nIf they don't co-ordinate in California on 6 June, however, it could be all for naught. Mr Trump has an imposing lead in the polls there, and big win will get him tantalisingly close to the numbers he needs for outright victory.\nA majority of Republicans are telling pollsters that they think whoever wins the most votes and delegates, regardless of whether they get an outright majority, should be the nominee. If Mr Cruz and the anti-Trump movement want to avoid the perception that they're stealing the prize from the deserving winner, Indiana has to be just the beginning.\nMr Trump isn't going to be caught flat-footed, however. On Sunday night he took to Twitter to condemn the collusion - and has been on a tear ever since.\n\"DESPERATION!\" he concluded.\nAnd indeed it is. Only desperation would unite Mr Kasich and Mr Cruz, whose political views and temperament sit on opposite ends of the Republican Party. The remaining weeks of the campaign appear destined to become simply about the desperate measures necessary to stop Mr Trump before the convention.\nBeyond that, now, there is nothing.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Dr Mark Lang spent six months studying the Lansbury Park Estate, near Caerphilly town centre.\nHe said many policies aimed at reducing poverty in Wales had failed to work.\nCouncil officials have accepted Dr Lang's findings which include offering learning opportunities outside the classroom.\nLansbury Park has already lived with the label \"Wales' most deprived area\" for the past two years.\nNow, the major economic research centred on the community suggests there needs to be fresh thinking about how we tackle the poorest places in Wales.\nPoverty is on the increase in Wales amongst children, working age adults and pensioners, despite attempts to reduce it over decades, according to the Bevan Foundation think-tank.\nIt calculates that dealing with the consequences of poverty is now costing the Welsh public purse ¬£1 out of every ¬£5 it spends.\nThose findings are now swiftly followed by a report into Lansbury Park, which advocates a new approach but no magic wand.\nIt is nearly 25 years since a range of social and economic problems were first highlighted by research on the estate, which lies just a mile from Caerphilly town centre.\nMore recently, Lansbury succeeded part of Rhyl to a title no one wants - officially ranked as Wales' most deprived community.\nIf you walk through the estate - home to 2,200 people -  very little has changed on the surface from how it looked decades ago.\nLansbury was named after a Labour leader of the Depression era when it was built in the 1960s and Attlee Court in the middle is among reminders of other figures from the party's past.\nCaerphilly council since 1996 has been under both Labour and Plaid Cymru control.\nThis \"deep place\" study was commissioned by the local authority and its analysis does not apportion blame - only recognising the approaches of a generation or more have simply not worked.\nDespite money being spent, and a Communities First programme running, economic and social problems have become \"embedded\".\nDr Mark Lang spent six months working on the Lansbury Park \"deep place\" study, with Prof Dave Adamson, who led the original research in 1993.\nBeyond the stark economic statistics, the research looks at less tangible but equally relevant factors.\nIndeed, the \"feel\" of the place is possibly as much of an obstacle to progress.\nThe \"sterile\" urban landscape, the lack of trees on the little green space the estate has, are all features; horizons are limited, physically and emotionally.\nSo as new councillors are soon elected across Wales, are there lessons for similar urban areas too? Especially at a time of austerity, council budget pressures, uncertainty over filling future gaps left by European funding and the forthcoming overhaul of Communities First.\nDr Lang believes it is about understanding the specifics of a place - and spending what money there is, more wisely.\n\"With some of the funded activities, I feel, they don't take the community out of itself; they don't encourage people to leave their communities and do something somewhere else, experience a broader world,\" he said.\n\"It might well be you spend the same money on supporting activities but you spend it differently, more intelligently.\n\"If you take people out of their community and engage in activities not inside it, you can broaden people's horizons and aspirations.\n\"That in itself will lead on to people wanting to gain more skills and better skills. We need to break through those barriers.\"\nEngaging hard-to-reach men in their 20s and 30s is the biggest challenge for those already running programmes to get people both fit and into work.\nEven the \"stick\" of recent welfare reforms has not had a spike in more people joining programmes on the estate, compared with other parts of the town.\nThose that do are helped towards interviews in construction, security and call centre work. Cardiff is only 40 minutes away by train and groups have been given work experience as part of their training.\nThe low level of educational attainment - more than half without any qualifications - is a worry if Lansbury is not to stay at the back of the queue.\nMore than half the pupils at the local primary school, St James, qualify for free school meals and last year's inspection report found overall it was \"adequate\" but called for an improvement in reading and writing standards, as well as attendance and punctuality.\nThere is a new head teacher in charge but the challenge is continuing and goes beyond the classroom.\nThe visual impact of the estate is something all are conscious of. There is something of a time-warp about the 1960s flats and homes, all in uniform colour.\nThat is changing with a ¬£10m housing programme over the next 18 months, which includes 320 council properties getting ¬£2m of new external cladding.\nAnother ¬£500,000 will go on environmental improvements and demolition has started of an \"eyesore\" footbridge.\nSian Denatale has lived at Lansbury for 18 years and four of her five children still live on the estate. One works part-time for a retailer and another works in a nearby food factory.\n\"It has changed a lot - for the better,\" she said. \"There's a massive sense of community, everyone pulls together. But we need help to improve the area like they're doing with the housing.\n\"Parks and a resource centre would be nice, an internet cafe for the older children - they go up town, hanging around the streets and the station, anything could happen.\"\nLorna Wellington, who grew up on the estate from the age of seven, moved to live a mile away but still comes back for an exercise class at the community centre and most of her friends are still on the estate.\n\"Lansbury's had a bad name for many, many years but you are who you are - there are other places just as bad,\" she said.\nHeidi Wilkie added: \"It's unjustified. I never felt lonely, there was never that isolation, you always had someone to fall back on, you could always walk down the street and knock on someone's door.\"\nCouncil officials accept Dr Lang's findings and said all organisations involved have to adopt a mature approach, recognising past failures.\nIt was not just about more money and investing in buildings but focusing support on making an impact on people themselves.\n\"It's a cycle, if people say you're not good enough, you believe you're not good enough, and around it goes and we have to intervene,\" said Christina Harrhy, Caerphilly Council's corporate director for communities.\n\"The jobs and opportunities are out there, it's a fantastic location and with transport infrastructure changes we're going to be more accessible to Cardiff and the wider region - this community just needs the belief in themselves.\"\nThe report makes 22 recommendations, which includes offering learning opportunities outside the classroom and chances for young people to widen social horizons.\nIt also suggests involving the whole community in activities - not just singling out disadvantaged groups.\nThe phasing out of Communities First - but with legacy funding of ¬£6m from 2018 - reflected a view from a significant number that far-reaching reform was needed with ministers pointing towards a \"new approach focused on employment, early years and empowerment\".\nDr Lang said the lesson for Lansbury and other poor areas is that it might take 15 years to make a real impact.\n\"There's not a silver bullet which will miraculously improve things overnight,\" he said.\n\"There's a multiplicity of things you need to do, some small, some big, to assist this community to grow, to re-integrate into the economy and improve household income levels.\n\"That's not going to happen overnight, it's a long term challenge, a multi-generational challenge and you have to be honest from day one how long it's going to take and the scale of the challenge.

It also has more luggage capacity.\n\"We see this [car] as being very easy to drive on a day-to-day basis,\" Mr Flewitt said.\nAbout a quarter of the new ¬£1bn investment will go directly into research and development, Mr Flewitt said. This will include work on an all-electric prototype. Electric sportscar technology is advancing fast, led by the likes of Tesla.\nHe also hopes that the new range of cars will bring down the age profile of a typical McLaren buyer, which is 40-plus in Europe. However, the typical Chinese buyer is in his or her 20s.\nThe Track 22 plan will involve McLaren Automotive adding about 500 staff to its existing 1,500. A second production shift has already started at the company's factory at Woking, Surrey, and a recruitment drive has begun.\nMany of the jobs will be skilled engineering roles. Mr Flewitt said the market for good engineers is \"undoubtedly getting more competitive.\" But he added: \"Luckily, McLaren is an attractive brand to come and work for.\"\nMore than 90% of McLaren's output is for export, and the company has seen sales fall in China as the economy slows.\nIs he worried about the health of the global economy? \"You worry about it all the time.

They must not be ignored if we are to learn from them and to prevent repetition.\n\"It is also clear that a combination of factors led to some appalling failings in care, a loss of basic compassion and the prioritisation of inappropriate targets over patient care. In addition, leadership and accountability were all too often sadly lacking and bullying endemic.\n\"While there have been responses to the individual published reports of inquiries and reviews into failings in care, there is little evidence to suggest that we are tackling the underlying systemic failings which exist.\"\nThe report recommended that hospital staffing levels should be based on \"best evidence\". It said priority should be given to developing minimum safe staffing for acute medicine and medicine for the elderly wards.\nAmong its 20 recommendations was a suggestion that there should be less reliance on locum and agency staff, and a call for quality of care to be put ahead of meeting targets,\nIt also raised concerns about staff sickness, saying this could be an indication of deteriorating morale and should be used as \"an early warning system\".\nRoyal College of Nursing Scotland Director Theresa Fyffe said: \"These are hard-hitting recommendations and will make uncomfortable reading for many managers and leaders in our health service.\"\nShe added: \"Too often, failures in care are down to unsafe staffing levels.

It was a terrorist attack.\"\nAir Products, the owner of the factory where the attack took place, is a US chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nThe second attack took place on a Shia mosque in the Kuwaiti capital more than an hour after the incident in France.\nAt least 27 people were killed and almost 300 wounded in the suicide bomb blast.\nThe explosion took place around the time of midday Friday prayers at the Imam Sadiq Mosque in al-Sawaber, a busy area to the east of Kuwait City.\nA Kuwaiti MP, who saw the attacker, told Reuters news agency that the mosque was packed with 2,000 people when there was a loud explosion.\nImages from security cameras at the huge mosque appear to show the moments before the blast, with the suicide bomber walking briskly in long white robes into a room where worshippers were kneeling in prayer.\nThe blast created harrowing scenes of carnage in the crowded, stone-built room.\nAn Islamic State-affiliated group called Najd Province claimed it was behind the attack. The group has carried out similar attacks in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Yemen recently.\nIt named the bomber as Abu Suleiman al-Muwahhid, and accused the mosque of spreading Shia teachings among Sunni Muslims.\nSunni-ruled Kuwait has a large Shia minority, which IS considers to be heretical.\nThe third attack took place close to the Hotel Imperial Marhaba and Hotel Bellevue Park in the popular tourist resort of Port El Kantaoui, to the north of Sousse, Tunisia.\nAt approximately 12:00 local time (11:00 GMT) a gunman pulled a Kalashnikov from a parasol and opened fired on the beach, sending holidaymakers fleeing for their lives.\nHe then continued his attack - shooting and throwing explosives - at the pool area just outside the hotel and then inside, leaving at least 38 people dead.\nThose killed include British, German, Tunisian and Belgian nationals, the country's health ministry said. Thirty-six others were wounded.\nSeveral hotels lead directly onto this stretch of the beach, among them the Hotel Imperial Marhaba.\nBritish holidaymaker Steve Johnson told the BBC: \"We were just laying on the beach as usual and we heard what we thought at first was fireworks. But it was soon pretty obvious that it wasn't fireworks, that it was firearms that were being discharged and people screaming and starting to run.\n\"Me and my friend we just said: 'You know, that's guns, let's go'.\"\nThe gunman was later shot dead.

{"text": "If only there was a simple way to compare their strengths and weaknesses...\nWho's got the most campaign money? Who really electrifies a crowd? What is their Achilles heel?\nAll your questions are answered - on a candidate card, so you can test the powers of one against the other.\nTrump has been tops for so long it's hard to remember what the Republican race was like before he emerged on the scene. The New Yorker has thumbed his nose at political convention, embraced controversial positions that would be radioactive for other candidates, dominated the headlines and kept his opponents perpetually off balance.\nHe appeals to disaffected Republicans across the board, whether they're evangelicals, grassroots Tea Party supporters or even moderates. It's been an incredible run - but can it hold up once voting starts? He's shown a thin skin and flashes of a temper that, if repeatedly provoked, could eventually prove his undoing.\nDismissed when he launched his campaign last March, Cruz has cruised to the top of the Republican pack thanks to a gift for rhetoric and a campaign strategy that has taken advantage of the anti-establishment mood among conservatives. He's formed a seemingly unlikely coalition of religious voters, libertarians and Tea Party activists.\nTo win, however, he'll have to fend off attacks from Republican colleagues who overwhelmingly dislike what they see as his me-first attitude.\nRubio looks like a winner. He's charismatic, he has a compelling story as a child of Cuban immigrants, he's generally well-liked by the Republican establishment, and he's run a largely error-free campaign. That probably explains why every candidate not running as an outsider has done everything they can to tear him down.\nRubio is distrusted by grassroots conservatives, however, for his leadership on the 2013 immigration reform efforts that have since become politically toxic. He's the second choice of many Republicans, but he'll have to find an opportunity to break away from his mainstream competitors or risk falling too far behind someone like Trump or Cruz.\nMany Republicans practically begged Christie to run against Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination in 2012. That was before he became mired in scandal in New Jersey and turned many conservatives against him for seeming to be too supportive of Barack Obama.\nIn 2016 his brash, straight-talking New Jersey style has been one-upped by Trump and his limited resources have forced him to set up camp in New Hampshire in the hope that a win there will surge him into national viability.\nHe has solid political-street-fighting abilities, however, so in a crowded, rough-and-tumble battle for the mainstream Republican vote, he could still claw his way to the top.\nBush once was the man to beat. His huge campaign war chest and solid support within the party deterred Mitt Romney from entering the race and hampered other establishment candidates. He's proven to be a paper tiger, however.\nAfter nearly a decade out of public office, his political instincts seem dulled. He's constantly fumbled with his words, leaving him overmatched against more skilled debaters. His depth of knowledge on policy issues has been no match for Trump's headline-grabbing pronouncements.\nHis famous last name seems a detriment in the Republican electorate's anti-establishment mood, and moderate positions on immigration and education reform have hurt him with the conservative rank-and-file.\nHe's burning through money, but he still has plenty of resources. His best hope now is a long, drawn-out nomination fight where he's one of the last few left standing.\nKasich entered the Republican race because he perceived the nominal front-runner, Jeb Bush, to be weaker than at first thought. The Ohio governor has turned out to be only a slightly less flawed version of the man he sought to supplant for the mainstream Republican vote, however.\nLike Bush, he isn't trusted by grassroots Republican voters who dislike his perceived heresy on healthcare reform in his state. His sometimes-dour demeanour has hurt him during the high-profile debates, where he's struggled to get attention.\nIf he has a shot, it's in New Hampshire, where he's in a tight battle with Bush and other more traditional politicians for second place behind Trump.\nAt one point last year the Carson-Trump outsider duo dominated the race for the Republican nomination. While Trump continues to flourish, Carson has fallen on hard times, however. His soft-spoken personality now seems ill-fit for a campaign that, after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, increasingly rewards bellicose rhetoric.\nHe's also been repeatedly criticised for lacking a command of the issues. While he's posted eye-popping fundraising numbers, his campaign operation has been accused of mismanaged finances and beset by staff turnover.\nHe has a loyal cadre of supporters who believe in his intellect and adore his story of successfully overcoming childhood poverty, but at this point they're all that he has left. He'll need a surprise showing in Iowa, where evangelicals once backed him, to turn things around.\nFiorina turned out to be the surprise of the early Republican debate season, dominating the first undercard debate and emerging as one of the clear winners of the second, prime-time debate. She's never managed to capitalise on that surge of interest, however.\nThanks in no small part to the Trump phenomenon, she disappeared from the headlines for long stretches at a time. Her background as a high-tech corporate executive has left her with no natural political base, and she has seen a steady decline of her poll numbers.\nShe's once again off the main debate stage - perhaps for good - leaving her scant opportunity to recapture that earlier magic. With limited campaign resources, she's been unable to build much of a ground game in the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\nPaul was once labelled \"the most interesting man in politics\" and predicted to be a force in the Republican nomination fight. If he could put a more mainstream spin on the libertarian appeal of the past presidential campaigns of his father, Ron Paul, he could carve out enough support to come out on top in a crowded field.\nInstead, he seems to have alienated the libertarians, while the Republican establishment suspects his views on national security and foreign policy are too dovish. His fundraising has underwhelmed, as he's failed to attract deep-pocketed donors and the grassroots contributions pale compared to his father's money-generating machine.\nHe's shown a thin skin when facing hostile media questioning, and while he's offered a contrasting viewpoint during the Republican debates, there just don't seem to be enough Republican primary voters out there who agree with him.\nIt seems hard to believe, but Santorum won the Iowa caucuses four years ago and amassed enough votes to finish second behind Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. At the time his combination of evangelical support and working-class sensibilities were an appealing contrast to Romney's corporate gloss for many Republican voters.\nThis time around, there are simply too many other candidates with more money, more experience and more personality for Santorum to compete.\nHe's staking everything on another surprise showing in Iowa, but there are no indications that lightning will strike twice.\nIf Santorum is yesterday's candidate, then Huckabee is the candidate from the day before yesterday. He was the surprise winner of the Iowa caucuses in 2008, running as a good-humoured conservative with a folksy charm.\nThe former Arkansas governor then eschewed a continued political career for a run as a radio and television talk show host, passing on a chance to run as a favourite in 2012. Now, like Santorum, he's been outmanoeuvred and outgunned by a host of new faces, and he's never been able to gain traction on his old terrain in Iowa or elsewhere.\nHe's still got the gift for gab, but his jokes are now on display in the undercard debates and his time appears to be running out.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls.\nNone of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles.\n\"We were looking for four months,\" she recalls, \"with a casting director and two assistants.

You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies.\n\"When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters.

{"text": "The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one.\nIn the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times.\nDuring the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes.\nIf you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions.\nThe IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a \"Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping\" campaign.\nSince then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015.\nParalympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption.\n\"It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs.

{"text": "Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years.\nThe work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya.\nThis early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation.\nThe principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine.\nThe virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far.\nHowever, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection.\nFollow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results.\nIn the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines.\nOne of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops.\nThis is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area.\nDr Gilmour said: \"I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position.\n\"We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted.\n\"Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine.\n\"HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it.\"\nThe trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response.\nDr Gilmour added: \"Delivering the vaccine into the nose has public health benefits, because we're not using needles.\n\"If we see strong immune responses, we go into the larger second phase of testing whether the vaccine is effective in reducing transmission or lowering the load of the virus.\n\"The Sendai product is modified from a virus which affects rodents, including hamsters. From our perspective, it's a bonus that this virus has lived in the human environment without causing us harm.\"\nThe IAVI laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster handles almost 100,000 blood samples a year and has supported more than 20 other vaccine trials.\nIts work includes sending test kits to sub-Saharan African countries at the heart of the Aids epidemic, carefully tracking the thousands of blood samples that it holds and ships elsewhere, and ensuring the data and paperwork from trials is rigorously monitored, so the results from different sets of tests can be pooled.\nJason Warriner, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"We welcome investment in the search for a vaccine against HIV. This research is in its very earliest stages. Clinical trials take several years to complete and, even if the vaccine passes this first stage of tests, more research will be needed over the course of many years.\n\"Although an HIV vaccine has so far remained stubbornly out of reach, we now understand how to prevent transmission better than ever before.\n\"A combination of widespread condom use, regular testing for HIV, and getting those with the virus onto the right treatment, could drastically reduce HIV within a generation.\"", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}
{"text": "Strictly speaking, though, it is not a tax at all.\nThe government says it is simply removing the \"spare room subsidy\" which put social sector tenants in a better position than those in the private rental sector.\nMinisters argue the changes will encourage people to downsize to smaller properties, and in doing so,  help cut the ¬£23bn annual bill for housing benefit, free up living space for overcrowded families, and encourage people to get jobs.\nBut housing charities have warned that the result will be higher levels of rent arrears and greater homelessness.\nThe government estimates that over half a million tenants are affected by the new rules, which took effect in April this year.\nMore than half of those affected have a disability causing them \"significant difficulty in one or more areas of the individual's life\", the Department for Work and Pensions has said.\nThe government predicts that savings to the taxpayer will amount to ¬£505m in 2013-14, and ¬£540m in the year after.\nWhat has changed?\nThe new rules affect housing benefit, which is paid to less well-off tenants to help with rent. Typically claimants receive between ¬£50 and ¬£100 a week.\nBut since April 2013 families deemed to have too much living space by their local authorities receive a reduced payment.  Under the government's so-called \"size criteria\", families are assessed for the number of bedrooms they actually need.\nWho is affected?\nThis change affects council tenants, and those who rent from housing associations, who are housing benefit claimants. It does not affect private sector tenants who are already subject to certain rules.\nThe government estimates that 660,000 households will have their benefit cut, roughly a third of social sector claimants. Only those of working age will see reduced payments.\nBut there are some other exemptions too.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the 5,000 approved foster carers in the UK would continue to receive rent payments towards an \"additional room\" as long as they have fostered a child or become an approved foster carer in the previous 12 months.\nAnd families with adult children serving in the armed forces will also be exempt from the changes, even when they are on overseas deployment. They will be treated as if they were continuing to live at home.\nHow much have people lost?\nIf tenants are deemed to have one spare room, the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit will be cut by 14%. If they have two or more spare rooms, the cut will be 25%.\nThe government says that means an average loss of about ¬£14 a week for council tenants. Those who rent from housing associations are facing an average loss of about ¬£16 a week.\nTenants can downsize, but problems have arisen in some areas where there is a shortage of smaller homes. Campaigners say those affected face being forced to move long distances to find a property, or move into the private sector, where rents could be higher.\nHow many bedrooms are you allowed?\nThe new rules allow one bedroom for each adult or couple. Children under the age of 16 are expected to share, if they are the same gender, and those under 10 are expected to share whatever their gender.\nFollowing a legal challenge, the government said severely disabled children unable to share a room would be exempt - although campaigners say there is still uncertainty about this.\nDisabled tenants will be allowed a bedroom for full-time live-in or overnight carers. If a full-time carer is a husband, wife or partner, then they will be expected to share a room. However, they can apply for a discretionary housing payment from their local authority if the disability means the partner needs to sleep in another room.\nDiscretionary support should remain in place for \"priority groups\" such as disabled people whose homes have had to be significantly adapted and those with long-term medical conditions which create difficulties in sharing a bedroom.\nThe number of bedrooms in the property will be determined by the landlord's tenancy agreement, so you cannot claim a bedroom is actually a living room.\nA group of disabled families challenged the rules in the High Court. What was their argument?\nThe families believe the new rules break the law by discriminating against disabled people in social housing because they fail to allow for extra space needed for individuals who cannot share a bedroom because of the nature of their disability.\nThey also argued that they need extra space to store their mobility equipment, such as wheelchairs.\nThe court ruled on 30 July 2013 that there was no discrimination, but the families plan to appeal against this.\nCan I keep a spare bedroom?\nNot without losing benefit. Parents who are separated are not allowed to keep a vacant bedroom for a child who visits.\nBereaved families will be given a year's exemption to rearrange their housing affairs.\nWhat about students?\nSince April, parents are not penalised if a student is away, as long as he or she sleeps at home for at least two weeks a year. But when universal credit comes in from this autumn, students will need to be at home for at least six months to avoid a benefit cut.\nWhat about lodgers?\nAs of April, claimants with a paying lodger are allowed to keep the first ¬£20 of weekly rent. But housing benefit will be then be cut, pound for pound, on the rest of the rent they receive.\nAfter universal credit is established, housing benefit will be cut, but tenants will be allowed to keep all the rental income (although only the first ¬£4,250 of annual rent is free of income tax).\nAre pensioners exempt?\nIf either one of a couple is of pensionable age, their housing benefit does not get cut.\nUnder universal credit, both will need to be over pensionable age, or one will need to be in receipt of pension credit, in order to qualify for the maximum benefit.\nWhat is the situation for tenants of private landlords?\nCouncils calculate housing benefit for private tenants using the Local Housing Allowance. This is based on typical rent prices in an area and the number of bedrooms deemed necessary for a household. The latter is worked out along broadly similar lines to those now in place for social housing tenants.\nThe maximum amount of housing benefit someone can receive as a private tenant is capped at ¬£250 per week for a one bedroom property, ¬£290 for two bedrooms, ¬£340 for three bedrooms and ¬£400 for four bedrooms.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

{"text": "Yes I'm talking about dual candidacy.\nHere's my quick guide. Unlike at Westminster, there are two ways of getting elected for the assembly.\nThere are 60 seats up for grabs next year. 40 are via the first past the post system, while the other 20 are via a form of proportional representation to get on the regional list.\nIt used to be the case that you could stand in both. Then Labour, when it was in power, stopped it, making the argument that it rewarded failure in that someone could be rejected by voters under the first past the post system, only to be elected anyway on the regional list.\nThe best example of this was Clwyd West in the assembly elections in 2003 when the four main parties fielded four candidates and every single one of them won because the three losers won a seat by also standing on their parties' regional list.\nThe ban has been reversed since the Conservatives have been back in power at Westminster who argue that it disproportionately discriminates against the smaller parties in Wales.\nThe result now is that it de-risks any attempt by big-hitters to go for first past the post seats because they can still have the back-up of getting a list seat even if they lose out in the constituency contest.\nThe unwritten aim is also to maintain the quality of candidates by ensuring that those big hitters who do challenge still remain in the assembly.\nThat is the background to the row about the confirmation of Leanne Wood's decision to go for a list seat.\nTwo years ago she announced that she would go for the constituency seat in the Rhondda.\nIt set up a contest against Labour's cabinet member Leighton Andrews in what will be the most high profile personal battle next year.\nLabour says the Plaid leader's decision two years ago was portrayed as a bold and brave move, which has not been reflected in the fact that she's going for the list seat as a back up. Leighton Andrews says she should have the courage of her convictions and only go for the constituency seat. In other words, her decision to go for the list is a cop out.\nIn response, Leanne Wood has accused Labour of mischief-making, saying that Leighton Andrews himself stood as a dual candidate in 2003.\nShe also makes the point that dual candidacy applies in Scotland.\nLabour says none of its candidates in Wales will be allowed to be constituency and list candidates.\nThe Welsh Conservatives have yet to make that decision.\nThe obvious question to answer is whether their leader Andrew RT Davies, who like Leanne Wood has only ever been elected on the list system, will feel confident enough to challenge Labour for the  Vale of Glamorgan constituency seat.\nNow that the dual candidacy ban has been removed, he could do so knowing he could still put his name on the regional list.\nIt must be a temptation for him to challenge,  knowing that the Tories held on to this seat with a comfortable majority in the general election, but he'll also be aware of the risk for any party leader to come second in his or her home patch.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

But the successful decapitation of his coalition partners turned out to be a curse.\nWithout a majority, it would have been easier to postpone the EU referendum that brought him down, and blame the delay on those pesky Liberal Democrats. That chance was lost.\nInstead, with the bravado that he sometimes enjoys to indulge, he pressed on. And another piece of luck turned against him. He watched the Labour Party elect Jeremy Corbyn to succeed Ed Miliband. Still unaware of how much that meant, he prepared for life after the referendum and the delicious chance to reshape his government for an extended swansong.\nBut Corbyn's lukewarm referendum campaign - and his unpopularity among many older Labour voters who pulsed to the Brexit message - compounded the consequences of Cameron's decision to go for a vote. And there was no way back.\nHe now finds himself in the unusual position of depending on his referendum arguments being proved wrong for his reputation to rise.\nIf recession is avoided, and Brexit seems calmer than the Cameron-Osborne stormy forecast - complete with thunder, lightning and financial pestilence - then he may be seen as a significant transitional figure who left the country strong enough to adapt to fundamental constitutional change.\nIf not, he will surely be considered - at least in the years immediately ahead - a prime minister whose rashness betrayed him, and as a leader too weak to unite a party still riven by the schism at the end of the Thatcher era that remains an obvious and debilitating rift, albeit a touch less ill-mannered than Labour's.\nThe Cameron project delivered some of the \"progressive\" reforms that he promised - he would cite gay marriage and the national living wage - but never stood a chance of healing a party in which many of the members didn't want those reforms.\nTherefore his legacy will depend in large part on the performance of his successor. If she finds a way of negotiating a way through the Brussels thicket that can satisfy most reasonable Leave campaigners and reassure others that 40 years hasn't been thrown away for nothing, Cameron will be one of the beneficiaries.\nBut think of the dangers. A governing party split more painfully even than before. Financial storms stirred up by markets and businesses who don't believe the negotiation offers prosperity, and take their investment elsewhere.\nPerhaps even - although there's been too much loose talk of this - an independence referendum in Scotland in two years or so, and the possibility of a Yes vote.\nIn those circumstances Cameron would slip fast down the prime ministerial league table.\nHe might find himself near the bottom of the modern ones, bumping into Anthony Eden, after whose downfall an American secretary of state said famously that Britain had lost an empire and not yet found a role.\nThe pervasive feeling of failure that followed Suez - much greater than the scale of the fiasco itself - could easily return.\nCameron needs a successful Brexit to prove himself wrong and - with a feeling of paradox that he will enjoy - rehabilitate his brief and explosive second term.\nBehind the polished good humour of his last prime minister's question time, that is the irony that clings to him as he leaves Downing Street - his cabinet, all his powers of patronage, and his cat. He is a young man, with a career ahead of him, and he will understand well how important it is for him that the political barometer turns to \"fair\" in Theresa May's first year or two.\nHe will look, too, with mixed feelings at the Labour Party. Having been hobbled by Corbyn's unenthusiastic Euro-campaign, Cameron will now enjoy the sight of the official opposition tearing itself to pieces in a leadership election and what will certainly be a bitter aftermath, whoever wins.\nAnd he might wonder whether, deep in the uncertainty that will accompany that process, there lies a coming political realignment that will intrigue and puzzle the centre-left for a long time to come. A change that could in time reshape his own party, too.\nBecause one day history may see Cameron one of the last prime ministers of his kind. Who can say, after the passions of the last month, that the two parties that have dominated our politics for nearly a century will look the same in the next generation?\nHe is likely to live long enough to see changes for which the last few passionate weeks, for all their drama, have only been a preparation.\nJames Naughtie is BBC News Book Editor and presents Bookclub on BBC Radio 4.

Some 60% of Protestants voted 'No', while 58% of Catholics voted 'Yes'.  Those adherents of the Church of England were 81% for the Union - the strongest correlation of all.

If he can do that, then the narrative in this race stops being Mrs Clinton's inevitability and becomes a question of whether the front-runner can hang on.\nIf New York is the key, however, Mr Sanders's campaign there may be stumbling out of the gate.

He also represented Wales at youth level before he was forced to retire aged just 19 due to injury.\nHis coaching journey to the east end of Glasgow involved time in New Zealand, Swansea, Liverpool and most recently, Reading.

We've got a real focus now that we have to bring success consistently and we're looking forward to building that.\"\n\"I've obviously worked with Brendan for a long time and I think we as a staff bring a lot of experience. Me personally, I've got a big interest in the tactical side of the game and enjoy looking at strategy but I also like to work with players and trying to improve them as individuals.\"\n\"He's excellent. All the big players that Brendan's worked with rate him very highly. I saw what Luis Suarez said about him recently and that's just testament to how players feel. He's got really human qualities that players warm to. He's really open and likes to be very close to his players and I think they feed off that as people. On the football side his knowledge and attention to detail is second to none - on all aspects of the game.\"\n\"Yeah, that's started. I think the one thing we've done already is analyse the past. We've looked at where we think the team is at. We've looked at all the goals scored and goals conceded last season. It's not until we get everyone back that'll we'll get a proper feel for the players and how we want to shape it moving forward.\"\n\"With all due respect to the previous management team, it maybe wouldn't be right to go into detail.

We've been looking at it objectively without the emotion of how it's been.\"\n\"Well, when we nearly won the league with Liverpool, we played lots of different systems. The most important thing isn't the system itself but rather the style of play. Whether we play with one or two up front, the most important thing is assessing what's important to win games.\"\n\"It's something we'll look at but as Brendan said himself, ideally you want to work with a compact squad. I think most coaches and managers would tell you that. He's been extremely proactive in looking at what he wants and what he doesn't want but we'll wait and see.\"\n\"I think we can attract big quality here, there's no doubt about that. In my opinion, Brendan is one of the best managers in the game and here he is coming to one of the biggest and best clubs in the game. So it's logical to think we can get some really good players here. It's hard to articulate just exactly what level of quality but I think we all know we need players that can make a difference and that's what we're looking to attract.\"\n\"The first thing is, they've got to be the right character to assume the responsibility to play for this massive club and they've got to have quality.

{"text": "The four-time Tour de France winner made his breakthrough when finishing second in 2011's race to equal the then-best finish by a British rider in a Grand Tour.\nWill he go one better this year and become the third man to complete the Tour-Vuelta double in the same year - and first since the Spanish race was switched from early to late in the season 22 years ago?\nFroome goes into the race as favourite but with six of the top 10 from this year's Tour and the likes of five-time Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali and Britain's Adam Yates in the mix, the Vuelta promises to be as tough as they come.\nThe race starts in Nimes in France on Saturday, 19 August and concludes in Madrid on Sunday, 10 September.\nThe youngest of the three annual Grand Tours, the Vuelta, like its cousins the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France, is a three-week race made up of 21 stages, raced over 23 days.\nPrior to 1995 the race took place earlier in the season but often clashed with other major races so was switched to after May's Giro and July's Tour.\nIt was first raced in 1935, and aside from pauses for the Spanish Civil War and World War II, it has been contested continuously since 1955.\nThe 72nd edition of the race is starting outside of Spain for just the third time after Lisbon, Portugal in 1997 and Assen, Netherlands in 2009.\nIt is often an unpredictable race with riders racing who have suffered injuries or health problems earlier in the season, or those trying to rescue a failed season, while riders like Froome are trying to maintain their form from the Tour de France.\nThe route is notoriously mountainous, as evidenced by this year's race, which features nine summit finishes.\n\"It's vicious,\" is Froome's take on it, while 2015 champion Fabio Aru says it will be the \"usual horrendous race\" and the \"toughest stage race of the 2017 season\".\nThe summit finishes are spread evenly across the three weeks with a mix of short, sharp climbs such as stage five's 3.5km ascent of Ermita Santa Lucia. It features gradients of 20%, while stage 15 finishes at an altitude of 2,510m in Sierra Nevada. The penultimate stage pits the riders against the infamous Alto de Angliru, where Sky lost the 2011 Vuelta when Froome waited for team leader Bradley Wiggins as Juan Jose Cobo launched a race-winning attack.\nAn opening team time trial in Nimes should not be long enough to create any significant time gaps between those chasing the overall victory but crucial seconds will be won and lost.\nRace organisers will hope the 40km individual time trial on stage 16 will help balance out the climbs but it could just serve to strengthen Froome's grip on the title.\nSprinter-friendly stages are few, although those that make it to the finale are rewarded with a chance of glory in Madrid.\nIn a nutshell, he can climb with the best in the race and is a better time-trial rider. He has finished runner-up on three occasions and goes into the race saying he has \"unfinished business\".\nThe 32-year-old also has arguably the strongest nine-man squad to help keep him out of trouble on flatter stages and set the pace on the tougher ascents. And, given his excellent form in the third and final week of July's Tour de France, Froome appears to have tailored his season to perfection, allowing him to also peak for the Vuelta.\nOn the eve of the race, he said: \"The plan was to have a lighter first part of the season and I think that's worked. I certainly feel fresher. But whether that's reflected in the racing we'll have to wait and see.\"\nFroome's rivals know they need to attack on ascents and descents in the mountains in the hope of picking up enough seconds to neutralise the time they will expect to lose in the 40km individual time trial.\nAnd that stage 16 is one that Froome has earmarked. \"The time trial is one day I'm looking forward to, a lot of time can be won or lost there,\" he said. \"And of course stage 20 to the Angliru is a massive stage.\"\nRomain Bardet - the AG2R La Mondiale rider was the big hope for a first French Tour winner since 1985 in July, but he knows he needs to up his time trialling skills if he is to finally win a Grand Tour.\nHe lost almost two minutes to Froome over a 22km course in Marseille in July. Bardet, who is riding in his first Vuelta, said: \"My ambitions will be different than in the Tour de France but surrounded by a strong team, I hope to make an impact on stages that suit me.\"\nFabio Aru - the Italian won this race in 2015 and will love the steep climbs. However, he too lost significant time to Froome in the Tour's time trial and is wary of the Vuelta's team test on day one. He said: \"I think I've recovered well after the Tour and have a good team with me.\nWe've got to limit the damage in the opening team time trail and be ready for the wind on Sunday. The nine uphill finishes means we'll be flat out all the time. It'll be good to watch, with time gaps each time.\"\nVincenzo Nibali - the Italian is one of six riders to have won all three Grand Tours and will be relatively fresh having missed the Tour after finishing third in the Giro.\nFroome has picked out the Bahrain-Merida rider as his main threat. However, his team is not as strong as Sky's and he too will need to attack in the mountains because he is an inferior time trialler. He said: \"I'm feeling pretty good. We'll find out how good along the road, day by day. I did a good block of training in the Dolomites that gave me the answers [about my form] that I was looking for.\"\nAlberto Contador - the 34-year-old winner of eight Grand Tours is calling time on his career after the Vuelta but insists it won't be a lap of honour round his home country.\nThe three-time Vuelta winner said: \"I have always given my maximum as a rider and I will do that now. This Vuelta is special, and I want to enjoy it. I feel lucky that I can be here, it's a really good place to say goodbye. So I want to see how the legs are feeling, see what kind of form my rivals have, but I have come with the idea of fighting to win and to enjoy it, too.\"\nAside from Froome, the Yates twins Adam and Simon provide the biggest hope of a podium finish for a British rider. The Orica-Scott pair are racing together in a Grand Tour for the first time since since the 2015 Tour de France and are part of a three-pronged attack for the Australian-based team.\nAdam finished ninth at the Giro d'Italia in May and has a best Grand Tour finish of fourth at last year's Tour de France, when he also became the first Briton to win the young rider classification. Simon won that category in this year's race, finishing seventh overall, his best in a three-week race.\nBoth are competing in a second Grand Tour in the same year for the first time but Adam is buoyant about their chances, particularly because they also have renowned climber Esteban Chaves in their squad.\n\"If we can get on the podium, that'd be great, whether it's me, or Simon or Esteban,\" he told Cycling News.\n\"Esteban is another card we can play, especially in the third week.

{"text": "In saying that, you may think I've gone mad - given that the Smith Commission has apparently made some huge decisions.\nHere is what stands out for me from today's announcement.\n1) The Scottish parliament will have total control over income tax rates and the thresholds at which they kick in (but Westminster will still set the tax-free allowance).\n2) Revenue raised from the first 10 percentage points of VAT on Scottish spending will be allotted to the Scottish government.\n3) The Scottish parliament will have power both to create new benefits and vary some planned and existing benefits - including the housing cost element of Universal Credit, benefits for carers and the disabled, and cold weather related payments.\nThere are lots of other important new powers being transferred to Holyrood, including the ability to lower the voting age, change speed limits, license frackers, influence the new BBC Charter, and - possibly - change abortion rules.\nBut it is the transfer of big tax and spending powers that creates significant fiscal and economic uncertainties - whose resolution may have serious political consequences.\nThe lynchpin of all this is what the Commission calls the fiscal framework for the new devolution, which includes a number of principles.\nPerhaps the most important is that at the precise moment that the new powers are devolved, Scotland's budget and the UK's budget should neither be bigger or smaller as a result of this transfer to Holyrood of new spending and taxing powers.\nOr to put it another way, the block grant paid to Scotland under the Barnett formula should be reduced to account for taxes devolved to Scotland and increased to account for spending transferred to Scotland - and future payments under the new Barnett formula should be indexed to protect their real value.\nOr to put it another way, neither Scots taxpayers or those in the rest of the UK should suffer detriment as a direct result of the new devolution.\nWhich is all very well to say, but my goodness it will be hard for Westminster and Holyrood to agree and implement.\nThe point is that income tax receipts and benefit payments vary considerably with the economic cycle. So determining at any point in time precisely what revenues and costs Holyrood is assuming will be pretty tricky.\nAnd it is not just adjusting for the economic cycle that will be difficult.\nRight now, for example, the British government's take from income tax is well below what it expected it would be, given the apparent buoyancy of the economy.\nSo what if the new grant formula was set on the basis of the current depressed income tax revenues, and then a few weeks later tax revenues suddenly and unexpectedly surged back to past trends?\nIf that were to happen the Scots would enjoy a terrific permanent windfall - and taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would presumably feel pretty miffed.\nSimilarly the Smith Commission says Scotland should have new powers to borrow, because otherwise it could find itself running out of money in an economic downturn that reduced its tax revenues and increased its benefit payments.\nBut that opens quite a can of worms.\nNo Chancellor of the Exchequer would want to give a Scottish finance minister complete discretion to borrow, because it is almost impossible to conceive of how Scottish sovereign debt would not be guaranteed in theory or practice by Westminster: the chancellor would be terrified of what Holyrood would do it if had his credit card.\nBut setting rules for how much Holyrood can borrow will be very challenging. What is more, any uncertainty about what tax revenues are available to service either Scottish debt or whole-UK debt would presumably make investors more wary of buying the debt of either.\nAll of which may sound a bit technical and dull. But it boils down to something pretty simple and important - which is the perceived and actual fairness of the fiscal settlement for Scots and for those south of the border.\nAnd right now it is impossible to judge whether the settlement is fair.", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

We can change the natural sequence of events for tens of thousands of years,\" he told BBC News.\nEarth has been through a cycle of ice ages and warm periods over the past 2.5 million years, referred to as the Quaternary Period.\nThis has seen ice sheets come and go. At its maximum extent, the last glaciation witnessed a big freeze spread over much of North America, northern Europe, Russia and Asia.\nIn the south, a vast expanse of what are now Chile and Argentina were also iced up.\nA fundamental parameter determining what dips Earth into an ice age is the changing nature of its orbit around the Sun.\nThe passage around the star is not a perfect circle and over time our planet's axis of rotation also rocks back and forth.\nThese movements alter the amount of solar radiation falling on the Earth's surface, and if a critical threshold is reached in mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere then a glaciation can be initiated.\nDr Ganopolski colleagues confirm this in their modelling but show also the role played by the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nAnd one of their findings is that Earth probably missed the inception by only a narrow margin a few hundred years ago, just before the industrial revolution took hold.\n\"We are now in a period when our (northern) summer is furthest from the Sun,\" the Potsdam researcher explained.\n\"Under normal circumstances, the interglacial would be terminated, and a new ice age would start.  So, in principle, we are in the perfect conditions from an astronomical point of view. If we had a CO2 concentration of 240 parts per million (200 years ago) then an ice age could start, but luckily we had a concentration that was higher, 280ppm.\" Today, industrial society has taken that concentration to over 400ppm.\nThe team says that an interglacial climate would probably have been sustained anyway for at least 20,000 years, and, very probably, for 50,000 years, even if CO2 had stayed at its eighteenth century level.\nBut the almost 500 gigatonnes of carbon that has been released since the Industrial Revolution means we will likely miss the next best astronomical entry point into a glaciation, and with a further 500 gigatonnes of emissions the \"probability of glacial inception during the next 100,000 years is notably reduced\", the scientists say in their Nature paper.\nAdd a further 500 Gt C on top of that and the next ice age is virtually guaranteed to be delayed beyond the next 100,000 years.\nCommenting on the study, Prof Eric Wolff from the University of Cambridge, UK, said: \"There have been previous papers suggesting that the next ice age is many tens of thousands of years away, and that the combination of seasonal solar energy at the latitude where an ice sheet would form, plus CO2, is what determines the onset of an ice age.  But this paper goes much further towards quantifying where the limits are.\n\"It represents a nice confirmation that there is a relatively simple way of estimating the combination of insolation and CO2 to start an ice age,\" he told the Science Media Centre.\nAnd Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London, added: \"This is an interesting result that provides further evidence that we have entered a new geological [Epoch] - 'The Anthropocene' - in which human actions are affecting the very metabolism of the planet.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "task_id": 4, "task_name": "xsum"}

How could an IS \"poster boy\" who had appeared in the movement's videos and been on counter-terrorist watch lists across Europe have made his way to Paris undiscovered?\nAs if this were not already disturbing enough, the authorities have added to the dread. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying: \"We must not rule out anything,\" has suggested that IS may be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in its attacks.\nFrench police have been authorised to carry their firearms at all times, on or off duty.\nReminding the public of these concerns (IS is believed to have used mustard gas chemical agent against opponents in Syria) may be no more than an ugly necessity at this time.\nBut of course Mr Valls was on Thursday guiding legislation for a three-month extension to France's state of emergency (giving sweeping powers to the authorities) through parliament.\nAs in the UK, this involves a difficult public debate about intrusion into people's privacy and the suspension of some cherished civil liberties.\nWhatever our uncertainties about the investigation, we have learned enough already to understand that it is a widening dragnet that is expanding across Europe.

It is noted that Ms Luczak speaks little English.\nPolice are called to a domestic abuse incident involving knives after an altercation between Ms Luczak and Mr Krezolek.  Ms Luczak has suffered a small cut from a knife and described losing consciousness from a strangulation attempt.\nShe said Mr Krezolek was drunk at the time and the children had witnessed everything. No reference is made by police about checking the welfare of the two Daniel and his sibling, aged 3 and 5 respectively.

Ms Luczak seemed to say he must not eat more than what was in his lunchbox, which contained the bare minimum, school staff say.\nThe deputy head teacher becomes concerned Daniel is not growing and of his obsession with food and organises a meeting with Ms Luczak. She says Daniel was taking food at home and getting up in the night to raid the fridge, but got diarrhoea as a result.\nEvidence given in the trial by school staff about Daniel, describes how he \"looked for food everywhere\" and that he \"would eat whatever he could get his hands on\". He finds and eats half a large cake meant to be given to all the children, as it was the teacher's birthday.\nDaniel persuades other children to give him food, which he eats in the toilets and takes food from bins. He also tries to eat beans being planted in soil and raw jelly taken from a sandpit.\nDaniel was seen on occasion at school with facial injuries. Because of a lack of appropriate recording within the school, it is unclear what injuries were seen and when but they include:\nWhilst there were references to \"black eyes\" being seen on Daniel, other members of the teaching staff reported having no recollection of seeing such injuries.
