Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups.

By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[â€º] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole).
